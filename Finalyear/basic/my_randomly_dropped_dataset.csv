"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again.",4
"I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!<br /><br />I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.<br /><br />I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try.",5
These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.,1
"I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol",4
"How to achieve potato chip nirvana? It's simple:  Buy these chips, get them tomorrow, eat them!<br />Repeat.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Best ""old school"" BBQ flavor out there<br />Kettle quality<br />Incredible price with Amazon<br /><br />Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain?",5
"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon.",5
Who doesn't like vegetables that are portable and at a great price?  Can't beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package!,5
"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less ""tasty"" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.",4
Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.,5
"I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form.",5
This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.,5
I recently purchased a bread machine and I tried  this potato bread mix.  I have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time.  The other great thing about this particular mix is that I have experimented with altering the amount of Butter ( in the last batch I actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water) and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyy!!<br /><br />I encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix.,5
I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.,5
"I love these hot chocolates. I think they're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks, and I never used to drink much hot chocolate.<br />I recommend these",5
"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.<br /><br />Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.<br /><br />I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.",2
"I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear ""skin"" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!",5
"These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them. Other cookies I like are Mrs. Fields(packaged), Chips ahoy soft baked, fig newtons, oreos, and elf cookies.",4
I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that.,5
"I absolutely LOVE this product - being able to have pancakes was my original goal - however - I made the pizza with it & was absolutely thrilled about the pizza<br />These are small boxes (makes two pizzas per box), but I would highly recommend - I am reordering a pack of three now!",5
This is one of the best GLUTEN-FREE mix on the market!!! It makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread.  Also it is a great price!  I have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best!!!,4
I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.,1
"My father grew up in Argentina and since he came to the States has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. He doesn't have to search anymore, I bought him a couple of jars this past Christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since.",5
"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!",1
"I found out about this spice blend in Dallas a few years back when I persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp.<br /><br />I like this Cajun spice for grilling fish. Recommend, but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least, or it will lose its flavor.",4
"So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december.",1
Unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best !,5
at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !,5
"I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders.",1
"I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead.",3
"This is the best marinade to inject in a Fried Turkey EVER made!  You don't have to add anything of your own (maybe a little olive oil, but that's all).  Plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey, BUT this marinade can be injected to make a tender, juicy fried turkey.  We LOVED it!",5
"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad.",1
"They are just that - 100 calorie bags of pretzels. Snyder's tends to have one of the best tasting pretzels according to my taste buds. These bags create instant portion control and are a great value for the price, especially with subscribe and save. I also throw them in the kids' lunch bags and keep some in the car for road trips.",5
Coffee is good but I don't care for individual pacs. Would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed.,3
"Are you sick of the regular flavors? Plain, apples and cinnamon, brown sugar....<br /><br />Yeah me too. This really changes oatmeal up. At least for me it did. I have been eating oatmeal for some time and saw these flavors and figured how could I lose. These new flavors are fantastic and I can't recommend them enough. If you think their too strong you could always mix two packets like me and use a plain with one of these. I don't generally do that but I like to use up the plain packets I usually have left over from the other assortments I get.",5
The vendor is fast and dependable. The tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too. Highly recommend !!,5
"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.<br /><br />This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.<br /><br />Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.",5
"I am still waiting for Peets to come out with Kcups, but in the meantime, the Wolfgang Puck's coffees are filling the bill. I really like Sorrento AND Rodeo Drive---smooth and full bodied.<br />JS",5
I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.,5
"I love Sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these K-Cups however was disappointed when I opened my Amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of K-Cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup... after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible I opened the first box and all cups were fine, however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and I had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere. I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good.",4
"This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.<br /><br />You don't usually think of tropical beverages being hot.",4
"My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often.",2
"One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.",2
I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it!,5
There was no seal of any kind on jar. Cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. Would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went.,1
"I do not understand the bad review below. The Chuckles boxes come to 40 ounces. The Chuckles bars are 48 ounces at nearly twice the price. That's right. The boxes cost almost half as much.<br />The boxes are big and inside the Chuckles are in a plastic bag. Yes, they are not evenly distributed. Oh, well.",5
We are definately coffee addicts and have tried tons of different coffees out there on the internet over the years. We go through a pound of coffee every 5 days. We have ordered from almost every specialty coffee place out there and alot of them were great ones but was always still looking for that certain taste and this one has it!! I am so happy we decided to try this coffee. We are now monthly subscribers. This is also the first review I have ever posted and I have bought quite a bit from Amazon. This coffee is GREAT!,5
"This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting ""Caramel Delight"" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. It's not that the cereal is inedible - it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. It's like you're eating ""healthy"" cereal - the ""clusters"" options make it much easier to feel like you're indulging and taste much better. Just be warned - don't eat too much. Don't snack on it like it's popcorn. It's got fiber, even if you can't taste it - and your body will let you know when you've had too much.",3
"I buy these for my yorkies for beautiful hair and healthy hearts. They love the salmon paws with broccoli, and no diarrhea  issues<br />from the salmon, because of the broccoli. Good for their sensitive digestive systems, and nice chewy texture for their teeth, easily broken up is a big plus for tiny mouths. Seller is very prompt and never a problem.",5
I bought this for my office. It was perfect because it fits just right on the mini fridge with room for my mugs on the side. We love it because you can now see what to pick from when before we were going through boxes of k-cups.,4
Tray fits perfectly under the coffee maker.  Color compliments color of coffee maker.  Non-skid top keeps coffee maker in place. Drawer is ventilated.  Ample storage space.  Love it.,5
"If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you...",1
Walkers treacle toffees are the best treacle with most desirable chewing consistency and taste. This package was well priced and delivery was prompt. I wish there was a larger per pack amount available.,5
"SANS root beer has &lt;1 carb and zero calories. I have been on the hunt for good soda without sugar, aspartame or sucralose for a long time. I tried Zevia and think that the SANS root beer is much better. No weird aftertaste and it's not heavy tasting, just light and refreshing. I actually finish the entire can and I never did that with Zevia. I highly recommend SANS root beer soda!",5
"I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider ""too salty"" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joe's ""blister peanuts"" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.<br />Sorry I got them.",2
"its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you....great quality, easy to clean, to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go....WELL PRESERVED",5
"I made the mistake of trying to sprout about a half cup of sprout seeds, and it made so many sprouts it lasted us two weeks!<br /><br />Really needs some directions on the package in terms of quantity (I'd suggest sprouting a 1/4 cup of seeds to start!).<br /><br />The sprouts are really great on salads.  Have a little bit of a hot mustard bite.<br /><br />My only concern is the price.  $13 a pound for sprouts seems a little high to me, even though these are quality sprouts (and free shipping).<br /><br />So I gave the sprouts four stars based on lack of directions on the package and price.",4
"We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell.",5
"Dog treats. What do you do with dog treats? Well, if you have a dog that is very food-centered, then dog treats are the best thing going as you can use them as the necessary treats for helping in training your dog, or maintaining his/her training later on in their lives.<br /><br />We have a big dog, so training her is a must. These treats are definitely a hit with our pooch! They are also small enough that we do not feel too bad using several during a training session. They are dry squares with a look and feel of thick crackers. Once you open the bag, there are many pieces, but there is a line through the center which means that you can break them in half pretty easily. This extends the amount of them you can use by two.<br /><br />I cannot vouch for how they taste but they certainly attract my dog and she is very attentive when I bring the bag out. The label talks about the ingredients being organic, consisting of Lamb and Barley - which is all to the good as there are dogs that are not happy with corn-based products, etc.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice product and one that my dog appreciates, and I would definitely consider purchasing them at my store.",4
"I can't give these less than 3 stars because... well, dogs eat them.<br /><br />However, be aware that these are another brand of extremely hard dog biscuit, while most dogs I have known seem to get most excited by softer (and stinkier) treats.  In fact, these might even be harder than the common milkbone stuff.  I can't comment on taste, but soft and stinky definitely get the biggest reactions.",3
"Of course most dogs do love a treat, but I have found some they actually wouldn't eat.<br />Not the case here.  These are light and come where you can break them in half for small or larger dogs.<br /><br />Although more pricey then say Milkbones, you know exactly what's in these treats.  No added preservatives, etc.<br /><br />I've tried several of Newman's products and have found them to be excellent in quality.... plus the company donates a large portion of their profits to charity.<br /><br />Buying this product for your dog not only makes the dog happy, but you can rest assured you're purchasing from a quality company.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF",5
I like hot stuff but this thing was a killer.  I put a tiny dab of it on a toothpick and was sick the rest of the day.,1
Ive bought these on a couple other occasions---and I swear they downsized the packages..They are good but a pack used to fill me now im not.I guess thats the trend--in ice cream and hormel chili the sizes have been trimmed so you wouldnt notice.  well looks like the Chinese are up to our tricks.  But they are still good just not the deal they used to be.,4
"i guess its because i LOVE sugar that this particular item tasted only a little bit less than cardboard! YUK! sure, i will eat the entire 2 boxes i got for FREE but i wont be enjoying it though. these needed just a bit more sweetness, so i suppose i can always dip them in honey to get the flavour i want. other than that they have a lot of good stuff in them thats good for you, but i like what goes in my mouth to have some flavour to it as well",3
"I try not to each a lot of processed food, but occasionally I indulge. These are the very best cheese crunchies and gluten free too! I have found these at New Seasons in Portland Oregon every once in a while, but wish they were more readily available. Very good!!!!",5
"Nabisco ""Big"" Wheat Thins taste great despite a name that didn't exactly excite me about trying them. They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?<br /><br />Overall, Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!",5
Always brews great in my tall cup. Many other coffees tend to be too weak when you use the larger cup settings but not this one... Like I said... Yum!!,5
"Aweful, Especially compared to their old Four Cheese Queso, which our family loved. Why would they drop the old Four Cheese?",1
"Being from the mitten state I like my vernors & often by it. I have to let it sit for a while before drinking it, or it makes me sneeze. Other than that it's great! I'll keep buying it because it's Made in Michigan.",5
"These fabulous little red pearls are even better than Craisins!  Plump, juicy and perfect in banana bread.  The semi-tart cherry flavor has body and a definitive taste.  Will buy these again and again. Great surprise.",5
"Let me keep it short and to the point.  This rice is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I use an automatic rice cooker so there is no work or guessing involved.  Put in 3 cups of rice, add water to the line, and 45 minutes later it is done perfectly.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of ""crunch"" left in it after cooking.  The Soft Wheat & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture as does the wild rice.  And this rice has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!<br /><br />I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Red Rice with Pearled Barley & Rye Berries.  I alternate between these two varieties to keep things interesting.",5
"I used to drink Crystal Light over 10 years ago.  The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.<br /><br />Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two-lemonade and raspberry lemonade- are also delicious.<br /><br />Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.  None of them are my favorite (I prefer fruit punch and pink lemonade) but I really like this product.",5
"I've tried several others but, because of its good reviews, I ordered Newman's (and also because I like all other Newman's).  It's as bold as advertised.",5
"Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies has my vote for the best cookies on the plannet.<br /><br />Problem was in the shipping/packaging, since in the 4 packs I've opened, I can count on 2 hands the number of whole (unbroken) cookies I've gotten. Most of the cookies are in pieces as big as or smaller than a quarter.<br /><br />I'd think twice about ordering cookies via the net.",3
"Wasn't sure how easy this product would be to locate, was so happy to find it at Amazon. This is a delicious product great for smoothies or sandwiches, the taste is amazingly smooth and peanutty great texture. I would highly recommend it for people like myself that is watching their calories and salt and sugar intake. Amazon is an excellent resource for hard to find products and their service is outstanding.",5
"Being a peanut butter lover, have to keep it out of my house or it disappears way too fast.  So when I found powdered peanut butter (with more than half the fat removed, but with the same peanutty taste), I was in heaven.<br /><br />Now I can mix it with my yogurt and/or ice cream; make my peanut butter pie and don't feel quite as guilty while totally enjoying the flavor.<br /><br />And ... so does my daughter-in-law who is a big fan of peanut butter also.<br /><br />So for all those peanut butter lovers out there, I highly recommend the Powdered Peanut Butter!!!",4
"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!",5
"My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.",4
Way better than Red Bull and healthier too! Cannot stop drinking this stuff! Gets me going in the morning and keeps me going in the afternoon! Carbonated orange is the way to go!,5
"I never, ever drink 'diet' sodas and try to avoid most soda in general.  However, I do really enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G"">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the ""french sweet birch oil"" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is ""60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols.""  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!  If you're okay with that, the taste is nice.  But if, like me, that is exactly what you are trying to avoid, this product is not it.",3
"I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic.",3
"I had been buying Senseo coffee pods to use in my Hamilton Beach pod brewer.  The Senseo pods became impossible to find locally, so I looked online.  I drink decaf coffee, and it's often difficult to find decaf in different variaties.  When I found these pods from Baronet, I decided to take a chance on them.  They are so much better than the ones from Senseo!  The flavor is rich and the price is quite a bit less than the old pods I was buying. The Baronet pods are also stronger in flavor, which is great if you want to make a larger mug of coffee.  They come in flavors, too!  Highly recommend!!",5
"it took about a month for my 11m to start liking this salmon pouch.  the price is great, about a $1/pouch.  its very easy to take with you when traveling since no heating or mixing required. just open and put a spoon in it.  i will probable keep giving this to her past her 1st b-day.",5
"I bought this for my wife as a birthday present.  She absolutely loves it!  We love to drink coffee but hate the thought of having to make a full pot when we just want a cup.  The Keurig brewer solved that problem for us.  So when we want a single cup, we just pop in our favorite pod and BOOM! There is your cup of coffee.  Love everything about this brewer except for the price of the pods.  Can't wait until the patent expires at the end of this year...that should lower the prices on these pods significantly!",5
"I cracked open a can and my cats went to town. Good ingredients for cats too, so the occasional ""wet stuff"" makes them happy, so that makes me happy.",5
I brought as a gift (along with 2 DVDs) for 12 year old twins for their weekly movie night at home. They don't eat junk food so this was a treat and they liked it.,4
"Just made my first pot of this wonderful coffee. It was simply delish! Subtle hint of cinnamon. It wasn't overpowering, which I was worried about. I've had 2 cups already. I'll be making this lots! It's difficult to find flavored types of coffee that are decaf. Thumbs up! :-)",5
"I have always liked this tea but have not been able to find it anywhere.  I was so glad to see I could receive it through Amazon.  As usual, Amazon comes through.",5
This is the first time I bought this product for my 9 yr old yorkie... and she loved it!  The small size is perfect for her.  This box of greenies will give her many days of enjoyment!,4
"My dog is about 70lbs, 11 years old and diabetic. We couldn't completely cut her off from all treats once she became diabetic, so we needed something healthier. She loves Greenies and they're healthy enough for us to feel comfortable. Yeah, they are pricey but if you buy them on Amazon with the free shipping they are alot cheaper than buying them in stores! For all she gives us, the treats are still a bargain!",5
"Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware/feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition.",5
These are great for our dog and the price is great on Amazon.com for the large package.,5
"It is hard to write a review for an item sent as a gift to someone else.  It seems that when you order this you may receive the Chocolate, but you may instead receive the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EF0I0I"">Coffee Sampler Gift Basket by ig4U</a>, as my gift recipient did.  Thankfully she loves coffee, so it was not a total bomb, but her packing list DID say Chocolate AND I wanted to send Chocolate.",3
"This is working great if dry food pellets you use are of the right size to be dispensed relatively easily.  The earlier version had a plastic ""rope"" which was easier to clean.  Also, the glass in my 2nd one is broken.  Assume you will need to get a new one every 1-2 years or so.  I use it every day and my dog gets all her dry food (main source of food) from the bottle.",4
"We were using a kong treat dispenser ball before which our dog would just toss until all the treats came out and if they didn't come out easily she would just stop playing with it.<br /><br />The tug a jug is great because it requires a more complicated effort on the dog's part to get the treat out.  She finally figure out how to put it upright, knock it over, and then pull on the rope to pull the treat out.  the clear container and the smell holes keep her interested in the toy.<br /><br />the only thing that isn't good about it is that it can be noise on a hard floor.",5
"Good product, Good fast Service.  My dog is diabetic and it is hard to find treats that he likes and he can eat.  He really likes these. Gonna try another flavor next time.",5
"Your dog would love these smoky bacon flavored treats!  Soft but chewy, these treats are a big hit around our house! We highly recommend them for your dog!",5
Got these for my son for school snacks.  Everyone loves them.  They're crunchy and sweet and cinnamon-y. The only ingredients are organic apples and cinnamon.,4
"My husband loves the coffee, but this is the only one he's had that he has to continually clean out the machine because the cartridges don't remained sealed. The coffee grounds get inside the machine and in the coffee. After closer inspection, some of the cups aren't well sealed when they come out of the box. The price sounded good, but not for the quality and aggrevation. We will not purchase Van Houtte products in the future.",2
Almost no detectable coffee flavor below the raspberry aroma. Probably would go well for those that like flavored creamers. Mostly this is warm water that smells like raspberries. Very little detectable chocolate. I bought this as an alternative for my kids. It might work for them when the hot chocolate runs out.,2
"Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.",1
"I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull-tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do.  The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top.  I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason.",3
This is a badass dressing and you'd be hard pressed to find another dressing that tastes so good and has no calories or sugar.We love this on salads and we love to put this on our hamburgers to make some big mac copies.Give it a try you want be sorry.,5
No doubt this is great if you are on a diet and need sugar-free but this stuff taste so artificial and the coloring is way too strong. The sweetness leaves a strange unbearable aftertaste. I'm stuck with 20 tiny boxes and I don't think I'll order these again.,1
I myself am not a great fan of buble gum sinced it loses its flavor quickly but the sugar free is even worse.  For the kids they do not care and like that they can blow bubbles.  I like it because it will not rot their teeth.,4
"It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best.",5
"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.",4
there is no way that there is a decent amount  of ghost pepper in this sauce.  i have habernero sauce that is way hotter than this.<br /><br />according to the scovile scale that should be impossible.  this was a waste of money,1
"Besides the fact that these sardines are an excellent source of omega-3 fat (at 1.6g per can), these sardines are just plain yummy. I think of them as ""raw material:"" Crushed in a bowl and mixed with ranch dressing, they make 1 1/2 excellent sandwiches. Eaten from the can with beet greens, fresh oregano and a bit of Himalayan sea salt, they make an entree that dirties exactly one fork!<br /><br />Besides being delicious, these sardines were a bargain at $1.37 per can. With a Prime subscription like I have (in order to stream Prime TV and video to my TV via my Roku) the $1.37 per can includes shipping. Speaking of shipping, the box that held my dozen tins of sardines was too nice to throw away...",5

"I love this brand of chips. By far, I like the cheddar potato the best. Second in line is the sour cream, and third is the BBQ. I recently bought 12 bags of Cheddar on Amazon!<br />These are much better than those baked chips out on the market (in my opinion). Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes-people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).<br />The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).<br />Yummy!",5

"I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.",5

As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.",5
I was worried at first when I read the other reviews. I followed the directions to the tee amdthe noodles turned out great. Telling all my friends about these.,5
"I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying these because of a couple of the reviews here. One person even said they were disgusting and she had to throw them away.<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised to find that IMO these are excellent, and very easy to use. Just drain and rinse, make any Asian noodle dish from Vietnamese soup to Japanese stir fry, and they are wonderful!<br /><br />Once when I was lazy and didn't feel like going to a lot of effort, I just pan-roasted them, sprinkled on some grinder garlic pepper seasoning, and they were good even like that.<br /><br />There are a lot of recipes I found online that I would like to try. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I think I could eat these every day. And I just might.",5
Very good.  Too good.  It is hard to only eat a single serving.  Going to need to bag this up into serving size portions to avoid eating the entire bag.,5

"I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or ""natural"" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.",5

"I am a very fussy coffee drinker and this is, without any doubt at all, the best of the decafs available.  You feel like you've had a 'real' cup of coffee.......not too weak, not too strong, but with a rich look and taste.  No one, on a dare, could ever tell that this isn't regular coffee or 'high-test' as I like to call it.  For the record, I've tried many different brands and Tully in general is always very good.",5
This coffee is absolutely wonderful if you like a strong full-bodied coffee that has no bitterness whatsoever and nothing but a wonderful deep coffee flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I ordered this amazing coffee and I have been buying it ever since. I have never been disappointed. It is truly bold and flavorful and when i serve it to friends they don't have a clue that it is decaf and most can't believe it until I show them the container!,5
"I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.",3

"The Ginger chews by the Ginger People are my favorite candies of all time! These are the Ginger People's pure Ginger candies and they are of excellent quality. They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the ""See's"" brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as ""See's"". Unlike the See's brand, these do not have a chocolate coating which is good if you don't really like chocolate.<br /><br />I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people.<br /><br />These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended! But if you don't want something SO spicy, I recommend that you start out with the Ginger People ginger chews first. If you like these, you can graduate up to the Crystallized ginger.",5
I use this for cooking and my protein shakes and the flavor is great! I love that the calories are so little. For clarification- when mixing it with water it does NOT yield what the serving amount is. Fr ex. A 1/2 cup mixed with water actually only yields a 1/3 cup. Just so you are aware.,4
Updating my prior review from  2009 as my dog was very sick with a mystery illness last year with enlarged liver and kidney issues.  I was heartsick as he was so ill.  I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.,1
"I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.",5
I have an elderly dog that is not happy to take pills.  I was shoving 8 pills each day down his throat.  Then I found these pill pockets.  They are amazing.  Now I ask my dog if he wants his pills and he comes running.  Makes medicating my dog a treat instead of a fight.,5
"There is no caramel flavor here to be found, unless you add your own. The coffee itself is good but it is very disappointing if you are expecting it to taste like caramel. For people who dislike flavored coffee this might be a good choice (though why would those people be looking at this product I'm not sure...) The description has one thing right - ""hint of caramel"". With this subtle a hint, I don't think anyone would guess it was caramel flavored coffee without reading the label.",1
"My 7 months old baby is formula fed and when we put this into her bottle she does not eat it. It is interesting because she does not mind her Shakelee multivitamin in it and I definitely can taste the iron in that(yes, I tried it before I gave it to her). We are going to wait a couple of days and try it again. Or when she is back to eating puree again I might try to mix in.<br />I still give it 4 stars because it is a great product.",4
"Our dog loves this food, mixed with a bit of dry food.  The price is definitely right and he gobbles it up- a win win!",5
"Timothy's is the best Hazelnut coffee so far, I have tryed Gloria Jeans, yuk, Green Mountain, ok, Timothy's by far exceeds all in flavor, and I am a hazelnut connesseur. You have to try this one! Colleen in Connecticut",5
"This dark chocolate bar is 54% cacao, with a solid chocolate taste--not overly sweet as some bars are, but not at all bitter. The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth without the waxy texture that some cheaper bars have. While the nutrition label lists this bar as one serving, for me it is two generous servings at 2.25 ounces of flavor. It is also 330 calories (200 from fat) which also makes me want to split it into at least 2 servings or share with a friend. It is easily broken into six substantial squares, so that makes sharing easy. Half a bar is a very satisfying treat. If the price is not too hefty, this is a bar worthy of satifying a serious chocolate craving.",5
"I love dark chocolate so Newman's own naturallly appealed.  It has a clean taste, but lacks the depth and complexity tthat you expect from a premium dark chocolate.  I do like that it is not overly sweet -- know it would be great to bake with.",3
"I like a little taste of dark chocolate as a sweet treat, that isn't quite as unhealthful as, say, a Hershey's bar... Newman's gets the balance just right for my taste.  It's dark not milk chocolate which I gather is somewhat better for you.  But its not disgustingly bitter tasting to the point that you don't feel like you're eating chocolate at all like some dark chocolates taste -- it still tastes pretty much like a good old chocolate bar (maybe slightly more ""dark"" / bitter).",5
"This item isn't bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn't have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this. It is the same with the one made to use with AXE products. Nice idea, but needs more thought through for practical purposes.",3
"We really like making this as a drink (FYI, it translates as Blueberry Soup) for cold evening, and putting whip cream as a topping. Not anywhere near lo-cal, but it tastes great. Each box contains 2 pouches, and each pouch is a handy size to make 2 mugs of soup.",5
"I first tasted this coffee at a conference center. Went back to the kitchen to find the brand name. I ordered the ground coffee first, but it didn't taste the same. Changed coffee makers, started using unbleached filters and filtered water, but it still didn't taste right. Finally ordered the whole beans and everything came together. What an amazingly rich flavor!!!",5
"There really isn't much I can say.  If you've had PG Tips you know the difference.  If you haven't you don't know what your missing.<br /><br />I'm from the UK originally and for years in the States I drank Lipton as it was the only brand I could readily find.  But along came Amazon and restored my access to my favorite tea.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking Lipton, PG TIps has a stronger flavor and if you brew it real strong it can get bitter on you.  However I used to use 2 Lipton bags to get the strength I like and just one PG Tips bag does the job nicely.<br /><br />If you're not sold, wait until it goes on sale or special and at least try one box.  Its particularly good if you brew it in a proper ceramic or china teapot rather than making it directly in a cup.<br /><br />Actually that is one thing to note.  These tea bags don't have little strings so make sure you've got something handy to fish them out with.<br /><br />From an Eco-friendly perspective I also like the fact that you only have the tea bags and the main box they come in.  Only the plastic shrink wrap is not recyclable.  If you drink a lot of tea using individually wrapped tea bags you are going to be generating a lot of unnecessary waste.  Particularly for those teas in plastic envelopes.  At least in Lipton's favor they do use paper wrappers you can recycle.",5
"This was the vilest tasting ""beverage"" ever. I like lemon and ginger - this is overly sweet, so much ginger that it burnt my tongue with some lemon undertone. Frankly, one sip was more than I could bear. It also left a very unpleasant aftertaste.",1
"Received my bag and tried it hot.  After all, January is National Hot Tea Month!<br /><br />Not enough lemon and too much ginger.  I didn't want to add more sugar since I'm diabetic, maybe that would have helped the bitterness go away?<br /><br />This isn't a tea I'll be purchasing.",2
"I am a big fan of herbal teas, but when my stomach was feeling sick, I remembered that I had this, and boiled up some water, and made this tea. All I can say is YUK! The ginger is so over powering, that I couldn't taste any lemon or honey. There was kind of a rancid taste to it, and it leaves a horrible after taste. I was thinking about trying to doctor it up with more lemon and honey, but the smell literally got me sick, so I dumped it out.",2
Love Love Love this stuff! Perfect in protein shakes! If you are in love with peanut butter but not the calories this is the product for you. I love to add a scoop in my protein shakes.  It makes the shake creamy and taste JUST LIKE a big scoop of peanut butter.,5
"I wanted a food for a a dog with skin problems. His skin greatly improved with the switch, though he still itches some.  He loves the food. No recalls, American made with American ingredients was a big plus (no Chinese poisoned food).  I took off a point for availability, which increases the price. Fortunately he is a small dog and the food lasts a while.  He has done well so now feeling safe to expand the diet to other flavones in this line for variety.",4
"These are hardly deluxe or whole, I was expecting larger and more whole cashews.  Good price still as i just fire these things down by the handfull....salt is a little messy but nice.",3
"This product is absolutely delicious. I purchased a case and received it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime. Its been less than 24 hours since I've had the Zico and I've already drank around 5 or 6 bottles. Its an excellent cure for dry mouth and is great for quick hydration. It is basically chocolate milk except not horrible for you. It may actually be better tasting than chocolate milk. There is some sugar which could be a concern for some people, but for people who consume it moderately and don't have health problems its hardly a concern.<br /><br />This beverage is best served cold, if not slightly frozen.",5
"So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.<br /><br />The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too.",5
There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.,1
"This is the first time I have tried this product.  I have never had the original formula so I can't compare it to what was a highly rated product.  At first the taste is somewhat pleasant but not very natural tasting and then there is a lingering aftertaste.  I will not buy this again and do not recommend it.  I want to try other brands. I think I will enjoy it because coconut water is not very sweet, low calorie and high in potassium.",1
I read Harlan Coben books and in some of them he has a continuing character who drinks YooHoo's.  I had never heard of them and never saw them in a store.  They sounded like something my husband would like so when I saw them on Amazon.com I ordered some.  He LOVES them.  I'm definitely going to be ordering more.,5
"This baked bar has the delicious equivalence of banana bread, and is a great on the go breakfast. Although it was moist, it was a little spongy, but nonetheless i definitely recommend it.",4
Very yummy! Just the right amount of moisture & the taste is absolutely delicious. Great for a snack on the go or for a very quick breakfast. Quite filling for a bar.,5
"The best thing Ive tasted in a long time. Great for when you have your period, going to school, work, workingout, or just wanting a snack.",5
"Excellent tea.  Normally I am a black tea drinker, but this is an exception.  Superb when you have a cold or tummy ache.  A must have on hand tea.",5
"Being on a low carb/low glycemic diet, I shop around for low carb bars as meal replacement or snack option.  I saw these bars at Kaiser Permanente (my HMO) and purchased them.  1) they are cheaper than other low-carb/no-carb bars out there, 2) they are actually quite tasty for being low-carb.  I think a lot of people who are not used to low-carb protein bars do not have the experience with these types of bars, so they make comparison to regular bars out there that have upwards of 25 grams of sugar per serving.  Of course sugar makes everything taste good, but that's definitely not my goal nor the goal of other low-carb eaters out there.  We're looking for bars that don't have the same amount of sugar as a candy-bar (like Snickers), which a lot of other nutrition bars out there have.  I give a five star rating, because compared to other low-carb bars, this is top notch.",5
"I have been gluten free for 10 plus years and have tried several different breads, but this one is the best!  I have tried Udi's, my second favorite, and Kinnikinik, also good.",5
"Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida. We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now).",5
"These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.",5
"Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible ""bone"" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.",1
"Thank god for the internet, as I have only seen these mints in one store while visiting Florida. Locally (Philly) I have yet to see these in any store, and believe me I've looked everywhere.<br /><br />These are a great alternative to the overly powerful Peppermints, and the ""Tastes too much like Big Red gum"" cinnamon mints. These are strong, but you don't get the burning tongue sensation with the urge to spit it out. Of all the Altoid flavors, this is most enjoyable of the lot.<br /><br />If you like spearmints but never had the chance to try these, I couldn't recommend them more. These are now my mints of choice over Polo Mints and another of my favorites, Foxes Mints. Now if we could just get stores to carry these maybe more people would learn how truly excellent they taste.",5
The T'eff flour was securely packaged. Service was fast. I made injera flat bread yesterday; quality excellent.<br /><br />I assume that most people who order this flour already know how to make injera. but having the recipe on the package would be very convenient. I had not had t'eff flour for some time and had to refer to my cookbook for the recipe. I was thrilled to find a source for the flour. Jane c.g.,5
"I don't care for the smell, but it works wonders to guard against breakage.  You notice a difference almost right away.",3
"Yes, dip, as in tobacco snuff. I like pomegranate. I like white tea. So why the hell does this taste like snuff? Brought me back to the two weeks I dipped in college and I couldn't even finish a small cup of this junk. I got it at Whole Foods and will try to return it next time I'm there.",1
"I'd give it 5 stars, however the cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the previous brand we used, though this is much healthier (and probably why). The unit price is good, especially with subscribe and save. And knowing the ingredients will allow my cats to eat healthy!",4
I really like this product.  Easy to store (no fridge needed) and easy to make (1.5 minutes on high microwave)!  Organic great tasting brown rice. Organic is a plus!  I highly reccomend this.,5
"We've been using Stevia Extract Powder for years and recommend it's use especially for people with diabetic conditions, or simply wanting to drop the calories from sugar use....The 1 pound price of $47 (NOW product), including shipping was fantastic... I would buy from them again and again. As usual, the product arrived professionally packed and intact..",5
"Doing harvest, Halloween and Thanksgiving lollipops so pumpkin is a must. Love the overtone of the spices but actual pumpkin flavor was lacking.",3
"This stuff has managed to become a suitable sub for coke and is probably responsible for about 10 lbs of the 40 I lost. Tastes like a cross between a diet DP and a cherry coke. Since it's more expensive than regular soda, I limit myself to one a day, but it definitely satisfies that craving! Highly recommend!",4
"Not crunchie and few pecans. Similar to Krispie Bars without the crisp.<br />Soft,sticky,lacks flavor. Not what I expected at all.",1
I have consumed many kinds of honey.  This honey is the thinnest one.  It is so thin that I am suspicious whether it is 100% honey (water added?).,1

"I've tried the other lentil crackersw in a quest to find other than wheat based ones and this is by far the best of them all, so far",4
"I read the positive reviews and I really liked the price so I ordered these rawhide chips. My yellow Labrador Retriever weighs 80 lbs and daily gets a rawhide chip (primarily Walmart generic brand) as a treat in the evening for years.  My Lab will eat everything in sight (including socks) and never has stomach problems. After giving him only four rawhide chips in two days, my Lab developed a severe case of diarrhea and he's still sick after four days.  He is an inside dog which makes it a real problem since he needs to go out hourly to do his business. Plus he's not feeling well and just lies around. I called the vet right away, and he recommended some immodium-type medication short term only. Since his appetite is fine and he isn't throwing up and he isn't getting any worse, his vet and I think he will be fine.  The vet advised me to throw away the rest of the rawhide which I have done.  I called Amazon.com and my money was cheerfully refunded which I greatly appreciate since I used the refund to buy the immodium medication.<br /><br />This is just a warning to make sure you only give your dog one bone chip at a time and wait a day or so to make sure he can tolerate it.  I don't know why these rawhides made my dog so sick but it could have been just a problem with this batch. I won't be buying this product again but I will definitely continue to buy from Amazon.com",1
"The product inside of the can is probably ok, but the nozzle does not work, so my dogs will never know. I will not buy this product on line again!",1
"A very good value, for the whole family! 1 package, instead of 5 2 lb bags. Great for all kitchen sweetening, from cakes to candies or just a large supply for beverages, from coffee and tea to a myriad of cold beverages. A must have, at a good price.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJ4XJ0"">Domino Sugar - 10 lb. bag</a>",5

"After starting a grain-free diet for health reasons I was sidelined from nutella, as it contains corn syrup. I was delighted to find nocciolata, which I prefer anyhow!! I eat a couple spoonfuls from the jar every night...mmmmm even better than ice cream!",5
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.,3
"my dog loves the power bones, my sons dogs wouldnt obey me untill i strted  feeding them power bones, now they are excited when they see me coming!",4
"I've always liked Bigelow teas. I've tried countless other brands but I always seem to keep coming back. Bigelow is not the most inexpensive tea available but there's a reason for it's consistently good quality and freshness. Extra money is well spent in packaging as each tea bag is individually wrapped in airtight foil pouches virtually guaranteeing the freshest possible brew one can get. By definition, many grocery item preferences are going to be subjective as individuals tastes differ. Popular consumer magazines may rate a given coffee or tea as a best buy or as the best in its class but there will be many people who think the alleged ""best"" is far from their favorite.<br /><br />One thing I think you can count on with Bigelow, and this differs from what one other reviewer said. That thing is consistency in flavor and strength. Over the years I've found Bigelow to have this consistency giving me, the consumer of always knowing that I'm going to get what I expect. I do not find it to be bitter at all, though with the competitor ""Twinings"" I do. I also like many of their other flavors, Orange Spice, Earl Grey, Constant Comment and their Organic Green decaf, though completely different than any black tea I find to be of high an consistent quality. I really like having their packaging and think it reflects a higher degree of quality than is to be found in boxes of tea bags that come packaged loose and must be put into zip lock bags to try to preserve freshness. Having to put tea bags in a zip lock bag to keep them fresh is inherently inferior to bags that are packaged such as these. As with many things, one may pay a little more for a product but in the case of tea, in this case I think the few extra pennies do provide the consumer with a value added product.",5
"I bought these for my boyfriend, as I don't drink coffee. He loves them, drinks it several times a day both hot and as iced coffee.",4
"so we got this because it's organic, lots of veggies, etc all the things we think we should feed the baby.. but unfortunately it was a total waste of time and money.  my son would not eat it.  at all.  this is a little guy that will eat almost anything.  he's really not that picky at all.. if you saw him, you'd know, he's not thin!  but he would take a bite of this and spit it out, resulting in a lot of laundry and a lot of clean up in the kitchen!  i smelled and tasted it myself, and would have to agree that it's pretty gross.. and since we were stuck with this huge box of it, i tried everything, mixing it with fruit, dipping fruit / bread/ anything into it... and he would not eat it.  the earth's best jarred foods has a strange chemically taste / smell to it.  my son had no problem with any of the plum foods and i guess that's what we're sticking to now.  and to be honest, the plum tastes better to me as well.",1
"It's goes on really easy, and only requires a thin layer so it will last a while. Stings at first, but then feels great and your skin will glow. And as the previous reviewer said, it smells great!",5
"Used generously on salmon, tastes like alderwood planked salmon. Needs a generous application. Enjoy it on king, coho, and sockeye.",5
"Warning, ingrediants are wrong. Does not contain Erythritol.<br />But Dextrose instead. Strong after taste, even though its Reb-A.<br />Taste just like the regular stevia sweetener!",1
Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them.,5
"I really enjoy this flavor.  It is somewhat sweet and puts and finishing touch to whatever I eat, or as a wonderful flavor to relax with.",5
"I have ordered Taste of the Wild through Amazon before, but this time I received food that was rotten.  My dog loves this brand of food and it has proved to be healthy for her, but even she would lift up her nose when she smelled this food.  It was all I could take without gagging to scoop it out of the bag.  I ended up driving an hour the next day to pick her up some fresh food at a tractor supply store.  I am sure that this was a rare occasion, but beware when buying this food online.",1
"I've been eating Tinkyada pastas for over six years now.  I gave up wheat seven years ago (allergies), had tried several gluten-free pastas (yuck!), and then had Tinkyada (wow!).  In taste and texture it surpasses many wheat (semolina) pastas: When served unawares, most people will not know that they are eating a rice pasta.  It really is that good.  Bravo Tinkyada!",5
"Grilled taste, skinless, can be added into numerous dishes and/or salads. We use it with Roland Grilled eggplants and a bit of fresh onions and optional tomatoes and that makes delicious Mediterranean salad. The ease of use makes it well worth the price. I will be ordering more, and I hope they are not discontinued.",5
I didn't realize how much Ranch we use until moving to a foreign country where Ranch (as we know it) is nonexistent.  It arrived quickly and was well-packaged.  A nice comfort-food from home!,5
My dog absolutely loves these.  I don't have to feel guilty giving her one because they are low in calories.  I would buy these again.,5
The taste of extra strength is better than regular 5 hour energy but I still question the ability to give ME more energy. Would recommend if you like energy products.,3
I think original GOLEAN remains the best breakfast choice for anyone on a vegetarian or vegan diet and concerned to obtain sufficient protein.  Particularly if they are tiring of beans.<br />It also has sufficient chewiness.,5
"This makes a great cereal - so I have thought. With almond milk, fruit, and a protein this makes a well balanced meal, and is great for an on the run breakfast. Has a nice crunch and stays with you through the morning. Has good fiber and protein. With the recent Kashi controversy regarding how their soy is processed, I am not sure how long I will continue to use this. I have recently returned to my flax cereal on some days. Arrives as expected - fresh and well packed.",5
Seem to be over toasted lately. Haven't had them in years and when I tried them they were almost crisp. Tried a few weeks later. They are either hitting the shelves stale or they are being over baked. Wish they 'd go back to whatever they were doing years ago.,4
"Even if you're not crazy about bloody marys, you should try this mix.  It's the perfect level of spiciness, and you really need to only add the vodka.  I've served these bloody marys to many people and have received nothing but rave reviews- definitely try it!!  If you're in Houston, you can get it locally...",5
"Delicious.  I recommend it.  It tastes good alone, with lemon, with lime, a little sweetner, etc.  And the price is very good - and is also eligible for the free shipping.",5
I bought one of the Stash teas-don't remember which one. It contained gluten!  I am gluten intolerant but NEVER expected ANY tea to contain gluten.  There is NO reason for tea to contain gluten.  Celiacs beware!,1
"PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS are the answer to those dieting, or those choosing health conscious treats. I didn't expect them to be so delicious; usually bars of this type taste more like cardboard.  Not, PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS.  They are moist, crunchy with almonds and dates, sweetened with agave nectar and rich with dark cocoa.  I love them.  With only 180 calories per generous bar, they are perfect for those dieting or searching for only nutritious snacks for children and adults.  I will buy more to settle that chocolate beast who arises in me hunkering for a candy bar that adds unwanted pounds.<br /><br />PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS impressed me and being the chocolate connoisseur that I am that is saying a mouthful!!!!",4
"After trying both the Illy and Starbucks canned coffees several times I have to say that I much prefer Illy.  It's not the taste so much as the smell of the canned/bottled drink itself.  While neither packaged coffee drink smells as pleasant as fresh brewed, I prefer the plainer scent of Illy over Starbucks which always smells faintly of ""gym bag"" to me. (though I'm at a loss of how to explain this)<br /><br />That said: the Caffe drink is not too bitter or tinny for coffee out of a can. Though it's not difficult to get a coffee on the go, these little cans are convenient for around town or packing on picnics or trips.  I've had this straight from the can, over ice, and with a little milk added.  It's not too sweet and is a nice pick-me-up.",4
"The history of illy issimo coffee dates back to 1933 in Trieste, Italy. With decades of experience and accomplishments the brand has become a favorite of chefs and barristas in Italy and around the world.<br />This 6.8-ounce can of illy issimo Italian espresso-style coffee with 155 mg caffeine has a strong flavorful full-bodied taste with a touch of sweetness. I found it a big energizer. The ingredients are a blend of 100% Arabica coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. There are only 45 calories per can. The label says illy issimo's bold, full-bodied, Italian espresso-style coffee is made with the finest natural ingredients and will ""awaken the senses while you're on-the-go."" I can vouch for that.",5
My husband loves this licorice. We were able to fine it at our neighborhood grocery until recently. I was so glad to find it on Amazon.,5
"I eat these on a daily basis, they're that good. I can go weeks of having one or two a day until I start getting burned out, and after a couple of days I'm always ready for another. Special K meal bars have just the kick to last those extra two hours at the end of the day, or replace a junky fast-food breakfast. I feel like I've had a lot less problems with fatigue and stress since I've started keeping one handy all the time; when I start to get tired and grouchy I pop one open, get a short jog around the building, and I'm good to go. I go through about 2-3 boxes a month. After hundreds of bars I'd say the taste and texture could be improved just a little, but they're the only bar I've liked so much, while costing so little, that I eat it constantly. Never had a stale one. Get the subscription, it's so worth it.",4
"This is my second time ordering the 6-pack of Lundberg Wild Blend rice.  The rice just has a better texture than plain white, and is definitely more hardy and healthy.  I would recommend this to anyone, but urge you to cook it COMPLETELY.  It really is worth the extra time.  I usually cook it for about 50-60 minutes in the micro on medium in my Pampered Chef black steamer thing.",5
"There is a LOT of flavor on these nuts.  At first all I tasted was the Sea Salt, then the Black Pepper kicked in.

"This is by far not only one of the best gluten free pastas I've had , but one of the best pastas period.  Meaning I would pick this over most glutenous pastas.  Has a very great taste to it and will continue to buy this pasta for as long as it's around!",5
"I bought a bag of these form my dog. Unfortunately, every time he eats some, he would get diarrhea. It took a few tries to pin point the cause to these treats. It was a mess to clean up.",1
"This is a great treat to put inside the Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy.  My 60 pound 6 year old ""puppy"" goes nuts whenever she gets this treat/toy combo.  It is one of her favorite treats, it has a (moist treat) smell to it (which I think is tolerable and is what makes the dogs smell it from a mile away).  This bag barley lasts a month and I don't even give it to her every day.  One you open the seal, your dog will keep asking for more. Bag is resealable to help treats fresh.  Great for training too!",5
our dogs absolutely love these treats! They are nice and small so it is okay to give them several during a training session.,5
"I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion.",1
"I heard wonderful things about these noodles, wish I had read all the reviews and not just the ones on the first page. They were awful! My daughter wouldn't even try them but got a good laugh at me trying to eat some. I had ordered 2 (6 pack) packages to get the free shipping and so sorry I wasted my money. I tried, I really, really tried. I so wanted them to work out but they just make me gag. I've tried them with 3 different types of sauces, with soup and a stir fry. Still Yuck. Bummer, and I know now I can't return them. When I first opened the box I could smell the fishy smell. And now my pantry has that fishy smell too. Don't waste your money!!!!!!",1
"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone.",2
"The quality of this tea is not very good, especially compared to other superb teas by Two Leaves and a Bud. Mostly powder inside the bag, and has a very strong ""grassy"" smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it.",2
Just threw away 3 loaves of pumpkin bread that were gritty with sand. I checked on the internet and found others with the same complaint. What a waste!,1
"I love the Peanut Butter Cookie and Cashew Cookie Larabars. This one is a little higher in calories but changes it up a bit with some Chocolate.  Great snack or meal replacement bar.  I will be purchasing these again. My 10 year old daughter wants to eat them all the time and I give these to her before Softball games to give her the energy and nutrition she needs. This is a great natural nutritional bar with only a few ingredients, so you know they are healthy and they taste like quite a ""treat!""",5
"Good Earl Grey Tea but nothing about it was special. The ""double bergamot"" went unoticed.",3
Nothing much to say.  Same as last time.  Too bad the price couldn't be cheaper.,4
"When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these.  Not Until my father had handed it to my hungry daughter one day.  It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car.  You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped.  Being diabetic he needed something fast.  He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour.  When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control.  Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough.  So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital.  For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.",4
"Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware.",2
"My son is on a gluten and dairy free diet, and he loves these bars, they are delicious. Ordering them on Amazon is great, you get alot at one time and don't have to try hard to find them at the store each week.",5
"Recently I couldn't find Harriet's Texas Ranch, my favorite salad dressing / veggie dip, at the store. I am so glad Amazon has it, as it has become a necessary ingredient for our Texas Christmas dinners. We combine this awesome dressing with green cauliflower, shallots, cherub tomatoes, roasted red peppers and avocado for a beautiful (and scrumptious!) salad every year. Not too spicy and not too bland, it is also perfect as a dip for any vegetable. A must in our house.",5
"If anyone has a membership to Sam's Club, they have this type of SB coffee, same count box for $38.  Just a head's up.",3
"This machine is for the serious coffee connoisseur.  It has an adjustable conical burr grinder that creates the perfect grind for a premium espresso. Not only can you change the fineness of the grinds and the amount of water used but also the amount of ground coffee used to make each individual cup from 6 to 9 grams.<br /><br />I've tried it with my favorite gourmet coffee, Caffe Bomrad Torino from Italy ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NV44AE"">Caffe Bomrad Torino, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2 Lb/1 Kg Bag</a> ) and needless to say, the result was amazingly superb! A divinely perfect espresso with a crema so thick the sugar cube floats!!!",5
"I don't usually leave reviews, but felt I should say something about this wonderful machine.  We bought the Vienna Deluxe in 2002, averaging about 6 cups of coffee a day between my wife and myself.  I understand the Vienna Deluxe and Plus are very similar, most importantly it shares the same brew group design and grinder.<br /><br />Its 9 years of service includes 4 years in a foreign country hooked to a 110/220 1500W transformer (on spotty voltage, I might add, based on occasional flickering/dimming of lights in the house), and surviving being shipped back and forth.  During the outgoing journey, the plastic water container broke, probably through rough handling of the box, but the Vienna itself was fine once we got the replacement water container.<br /><br />5 years in USA was using soft water, filtered through a reverse osmosis system.  4 years in a foreign country was hard tap water.  I don't believe I've descaled it more than 3 times ever.  I usually clean the brew group once every couple of months.  Yep, we're not good models of consistent maintenance, and it's a tribute to the Vienna that it has stood up to years of abuse without ever breaking down.<br /><br />We used a variety of beans, including oily Starbucks, Lavazza, Illy, Malabar Gold Espresso (my personal favourite) and a handful of other varieties, although recently we've largely been using the cheap Starbucks large packs at Costco.  We're not coffee fanatics, but do have pretty high expectations, and the Vienna does not disappoint.  However, coffee is a personal taste, and your mileage will probably vary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you want pretty designs with shiny stainless steel, you'll have to pay more, and not necessarily for better coffee or better reliability.  Avoiding complex electronics and touchscreens in a damp environment sounds like a smart thing for me.  I like simple, reliable designs that performs consistently, and would look for another Vienna when mine eventually dies.<br /><br />About the only thing that I wish for, is an alternate way to feed in a different coffee powder so we can occasionally have some variety.",5
"These are delicious - the perfect amount of sweet, tart, and dark chocolate.  They also last a long time if you content yourself with only a few at a time... although I sometimes find myself taking four... then taking three more... then four more... they're addicting!<br /><br />To be honest, their chocolate covered pomegranate are even better (and presently ship free with Prime: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R81L92"">Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates 2lb Bag</a> ).  If you're between the two, get those.<br /><br />I found these at Sams Club when I went shopping with my mom, but without my own membership, I can't go back unless she's with me.  It's hard to justify dragging my mom 20 miles out of her way for a bag of chocolate covered fruit... so I'm thrilled to find them on Amazon, even if they are slightly more expensive.  They're so worth it.<br /><br />EDIT:  I would recommend waiting until the cooler season to order them - Amazon can't help the fact that chocolate melts in hot temperatures.",5
"First, a note about packaging for this shampoo.  It arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and inside that, the shampoo bottle was tightly taped inside a plastic bag. Good thing, because the inside of the plastic bag contained about a third of the shampoo, which had leaked from the bottle!  So, a different way of shipping this product is a must.<br /><br />Next, some more specific information about the shampoo itself:<br /><br />1)  The scent is very strong. (Best described as a fruity/floral.) I could smell it even before opening the mailer, and I thought that was because of the leakage, but the scent remained strong even after cleaning up the spill. If you don't like strongly scented products, this may bother you.<br /><br />2)  Bottle design is okay (product comes out a small hole in a flip-up cap), just not appropriate for the shipping method they use, as already mentioned.<br /><br />3) Product amount is 12.9 oz, and since you need about a half-dollar size amount, it should last awhile.<br /><br />4) Cleansing properties: It does not lather ""richly"", or offer a head full of bubbles, but rather has a creamy, low-sudsing consistency.  (Which is why I used that half-dollar size amount.) My scalp and hair did feel cleansed after use, even minus the big bubbles.<br /><br />5) Conditioning: I can't say whether my scalp was ""nourished"", but my hair DID have BIG volume after blow drying, and also felt smooth and healthy.<br /><br />However, the down-side for me, and the reason for only four-stars, is that, after two uses, I noticed some color-fading. Eeek! (My hair is colored once every 4-5 weeks, and I was only on week 2 of color when trying this shampoo. Usually, I use L'Oreal EverPure color care system shampoo.) Now, the color fading may be because I'm ""of a certain age"", and my hair doesn't hold color as long/well as it used to. Or maybe the change from my usual brand just looked ""different"" to me.<br /><br />In any case , I felt this product delivered on its promise to volumize and help with healthiness, but the color-fade was a concern for me. If necessary, I'll return again to add comments if the color fade becomes more noticeable.",4
"Everyone in my office loves these -- I think they taste like styrofoam.  Everyone's tastebuds are different, so I recommend that you try them for yourself.",3
Love this stuff.  So easy and reliable is so many dishes.  We use this to cook our brown rice on a regular basis and it comes out so tasty.  Easy to use for egg drop soup or chicken soup.,5
"I have been using Realemon for years, but somehow overlooked the fact that it has no<br />vitamin C in it.  A real lemon is loaded with vitamin C, beyond your daily need.  I use this<br />juice for cooking, but for drinking I think I need to get the lemon with the peel on it.",4
These are very handy to add to my veggies to make soup. Nice size chunks and drain the liquid and you can make chicken salad or even give a salad a topping. Keeps for a long time and always there.,5
"These are probably the best-tasting potato chips ever. Chips certainly aren't the healthiest snack food out there, but at least these don't have any trans fats.",5
"I liked this, but not enough to be a frequent purchase.  This is not a particularly spicy sauce, was flavorful but mild, so lacked real heat.  The consistency was thick and creamy, non-greasy.  Worth ocassional variety.  I do not eat Taco Bell enough to compare this to a menu item.",3
"As advertised.  This popcorn is perfectly salted and flavored.  If I had a complaint, it would be that a consistent portion of the kernels do not pop.  However, I think this is related more to my popper and not the product.",5
"This is a great deal for the ""cat crack"" tuna flakes.  This is by far our cat's favorite treat, and she goes nuts for it.  Not super high in calories or fat, so it's better than the junk food treats.  Definitely recommend.",5
"Although labeled ""Black Bean Chips,"" unlike the (now unavailable) Trader Joe's version these are CORN chips with some black bean thrown in.  That's misleading.  They should be labeled Corn & Black Bean chips.  They don't taste bad, as far as chips go.  But they are definitely nowhere near as good as the old Trader Joe's variety.",3
"When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.",4
"My postman started giving Maddie Greenies when she was about a year old, when he stopped I had to purchase them myself, she has one each day, she is now 13 1/2, she loves them I feel they are good for the gums and teeth, she has had very few pulled, looks good for a Senior.  I would highly recommend them to any one who has a pet.",5
"I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.",5
"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.",1
I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.,1
This is a great product and while my cats don't eat much of it they eat enough to maintain a healthy weight. The product I received did not have the X kibbles in the description. My cats would like it better if they were X kibbles since they find that easier to grab with their teeth and chew on. I would buy this again.,4
"My son has celiac so we have been searching for tasty pastas- this one is easier to prepare than the rice pastas (less likely to get globby) and handles sauces better- consistency is closer to wheat pasta also, has less flavor than the quinoa blends so needs a sauce to make it truly palatable-if you are looking for a pasta to go with a tomoato based sauce go with this one.",5
"I have a subscription to this product because it's so good, and you can't beat the price. The powder easily mixes into anything. It has a full, rich flavor with no additives or fillers and it's raw. My favorite way to use it is to mix it into coconut oil and agave, with a little extract like peppermint, orange, or lemon. It makes a lovely chocolate sauce that hardens on contact when it touches something frozen. I add the sauce to banana icecream, which is made from frozen bananas which I run through my juicer machine with the blank plate to make raw soft serve. It's a wonderful, raw healthy treat that I sometimes have in place of a meal. Go ahead and subscribe and get Amazon prime. It's totally worth it for this cacao powder.",5
"The cake was moist and not overly sweet, and the frosting tasted decadent without an artificial aftertaste. The dots in the cake itself were hard to see, but the ones on top of the cake more than made up for it. I will definitely make this again, and I look forward to trying the other flavors.",5
Typical energy drink with herbs and stuff that really don't work. Didn't like the taste.  Cool looking can is the only favorable thing I can say about it.,2
Just used this as a finishing touch on the gumbo - yum! And as a person of few words I know I have to write 20.,5
"Though I'm hesitant to call this kid-safe, since anything that scares away bugs seems that it would inherantly be dangerous to little ones, everything that I seem to find leads me to believe that it won't harm my little ones. I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction.<br /><br />I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks.<br /><br />I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work.<br /><br />Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase.<br /><br />I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays.",5
"I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals. I'll try brewing it loose leaf in case the taste is coming from the bags, but so far I found this tea disappointing.",1
I drink this tea almost everyday with a bit of lemon. It never fails to satisfy. I used to drink straight green tea but the grass-clipping flavor eventually began to nauseate me.  I'm glad to have found this tasty alternative.,5
"This is a good ""bold"" coffee, which we like because we like to use coffee flavorings. It came quickly and was good quality coffee.",5
Newmans beef organic beef never fails.  My pooch (miniature poodle) never fails to gobble it up along with the premium kibbles I feed her.  She'll eat other canned foods but the Newman's is her first choice for dinner.,5
"The black cherry flavor tastes  pretty good.<br /><br />Although my assistant taster and I did not care for the orange Switch, we  like the black cherry.  Most people are preconditioned about orange flavor. It is supposed to taste a certain way, but black cherry has more freedom to be individual.<br /><br />I discovered a wonderful way to use Switch black cherry -  cooking salmon!  I mixed the Switch black cherry  in the blender with a half cup brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey.  To that I added a shake of Chinese five spice, a shake of  ground cloves, and approximately 1 teaspoon of dry mustard.  I mixed that in the blender.  I sprayed a baking pan with butter flavored cooking spray.  Then I placed boneless salmon  - about one fourth fish - in the middle of the pan and surrounded it with slices of peeled pre-baked sweet potatoes.  The liquid from the blender went on top of  all of it.  Into a hot oven (450 degrees) went the pan.  As soon as the liquid bubbled, I carefully turned the salmon over, basted it with the glaze, and let it cook five minutes.  While it was still in the pan, I cut it into two servings, topped it with pecan pieces and returned it to the hot oven  another two minutes to heat the pecans.  It was pretty on the plate!  I poured some of the glaze over it.  Yummy!<br /><br />Switch black cherry would be nice in ham glaze too.<br /><br />Mary Lou Cheatham (Jane Riley)<br />Author of Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook",5

"I prefer to stick with organic versions of the ""dirty dozen"" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son ""eat the rainbow"" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!",5
"My wife drinks the caffeinated Twinings English Breakfast Tea on the largest Keurig setting almost five times a day.  I accidentally ordered the decaf version and she has been trying to drink these at night instead of the regular.  Unfortunately, whatever the process that is used to remove the caffeine from the tea leaves this K-Cup extremely weak and watery.  To her, the lowest setting is comparable to the medium or high settings on the regular English Breakfast.  If you're a serious tea drinker like my wife and you need a decaf tea, you might want to try a smaller box or some other brands before buying 50 of these.",2
This is one of the BEST spices I have ever used- great an everything. I found it originally at Whole Foods and then used Amazon.,5
"A very good tasting dried apple. They retain the Fuji flavor and are quite sweet. I mostly use them in my cooked cereal and they plump up nicely and add a nice flavor. They are cut thinner and are more crispy and less chewy than the dried apples I used to take on camping trips, but with the lower moisture content they are more economical. The apples are well packaged and should stay fresh for a long time unopened. I have had no trouble keeping the opened package fresh by folding over the top of the original package and placing it in a gallon size freezer bag. I am on my second order and signed up for a subscription (additional discount and free shipping).",5
"I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae.",1
Great for road trips and dealing with peanut allergies.  It's a great idea that I've been looking for when traveling for quite some time now.  Really great!,5

"The shipping on these fruit chia bars was very fast but it wasn't free. The mailman left me a little envelope saying I owed him<br />85 cents! Also, I thought these were sugar free but the lable says there's 23 grams of sugar! Also, the flavor wasn't that great. I won't be buying these fruit chia bars again.",1
"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.",1
"Well, it must taste good, 'cause my dog just loves it.  It did take a minute to teach him to lick it instead of just trying to grap it out of my hand.",5
This food worked great for my two dogs up until about a year ago. Something changed in this food which caused both dogs severe diarrhea. Trialing them off and then on this food again caused the problems to return. We switched to a different brand.,1
"I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others.",2
From the time it starts brewing it is waking me up. Fresh coffee aroma and sharp tasting great start to the day.,4
I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!,5
I bought quite a lot of these in the past. My son loved them. I like the fact that they are organic and the combination of fruits and vegetables in them is just right.,5
The sugar free huckleberry jam was wonderful. It tasted just like huckleberries. I have really enjoyed it. I will definitely purchase it again.,5
"I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!",5
"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.",2
Have brought this pasta to dinners and people just think it's whole wheat pasta. My husband and I really like it.,4
I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon.,5
"Lijjat Papad is the only brand I trust to consistently perform well for me. I tend to roast mine over an open flame (god bless gas stoves!), but my sister-in-law likes to do hers in the microwave. It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly.",5
"This is my kids favorite of the salts at the moment.  I like it too, and will keep it in my collection. Great deal also, and great company to do business with.",5
"DeBoles Spaghetti turns out perfectly, pot after pot. The trick is bringing the water (with a little olive oil in it) to a rolling boil, before adding the pasta. Then boil for ten minutes, remove immediately, and drain. The pasta is al dente and never sticky, hard, or mushy. I will continue to buy this pasta. It is much better than NRG and other brands.",5
"I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin. Also my dog, who usually goes crazy for elk antlers, isn't really interested in chewing it. I recommend ordering from Grateful Shed Antler Chews instead.",2
I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.,1

"When I traveled to Boston late last summer, the ex and I planned to serve margaritas as a prelude to several dinners for family and friends.  We bought the tequila and the triple sec, and I brought along a large bag of coarse sea salt.  For the limes, I suggested that she buy two 16-ounce bottles of Realime, rather than us doing all that washing, cutting, and juicing of dozens of the real things.<br /><br />That was a major mistake.  On the first night, the cocktails were bitter and insipid.  We raced out the next day to buy some real limes for the other dinners.<br /><br />This product is probably fine if a recipe calls for a quarter teaspoon of lime juice, or if you want a splash of lime on your broiled or pan-fried fish.  But don't use it when lime juice is a principal ingredient.  Bite the bullet and juice the real thing.",1
Nong Shim makes great ramen noodles.  This one has great flavor and the noodle is fairly thick and tasty.  However you need to add more water than the package suggested or it's going to be salty.  It's best to cook it in the pot with boiling water for 4 minutes and the noodle texture tastes different than my lazy ramen noodle mode (soak it in boiling water for 4 minutes).  Give it a try and their rest of the lineup (especially the udon bowl)!,4
My dogs love Greenies and my cost savings purchase with Amazon was perfect timing for me as I was almost out.,5

"I really loved this pasta! It tastes just like natural spaghetti but without all the pain and issues associated with gluten. Many other products would come out mushy and like oatmeal - but not this one, it tastes so much like ordinary pasta, I cannot tell the difference.<br /><br />I just purchased the ""bionaturae Organic gluten-free pasta"" because the Heartland G.F pasta has increased in price, is frequently out of stock, and no longer participates in the ""Subscribe & Save"" option (for those who aren't aware of this program, it saves you 15% and you can cancel at any time).  The other product mentioned, the Bionaturae pasta gives you 6 packs of spaghetti (rather than 5 included in Heartland) and still costs less when choosing the subscribe & save. The Bionaturae is offered in the subscribe & save and also has great reviews, so we'll see how it turns out. If it doesn't measure up to the heartland then I will just bit the bullet and order the heartland product.",5
This coffee is the best i have had in a long time.  It is so good that it keeps me out of local coffee shops.  I am hooked.,5
I was looking for a white coffee as I had some from malaysia. I could'nt find the same brand so I tried these. Not as good but my wife liked them as well. Not as strong as I like but I will rate them OK.,3
This product is very helpful in training my dogs. I find that it's much more convienant then treats. I will certainly be ordering more.,5
"Many of these reviews seemed to be confused. This Stik if really created and used for training dogs/puppies. It is much easy to give them a quick lick when they walk next to you instead of giving them lots of treats or clicks. This product is a god-send.

For what this does, it deserves a better rating.",5

"I am definitely in the middle of the fence regarding this product. :-(<br /><br />The good:<br />* Non-BPA packaging (as we all know, almost impossible to find for a plain tomato product)<br />* low in sodium<br />* not sourced in China<br /><br />Now for what I consider the downsides (other than the price, which may not be a deterrent to some).<br /><br />First, compared to the no-salt-added product I used to use (Del Monte Petite Cut Tomatoes, No Salt Added), I do think these tomatoes have FAR less taste. The difference is not due to salt content because the sodium content as given on the packaging of both products is the same. IMHO the Pomi tomatoes taste less ""tomato-y"" than what I used to buy (a friend who also tried the Pomi said she finds the taste ""insipid""). But that is not my main gripe.<br /><br />The package claims 26 1/2 oz net weight (approximately, but close enough). However, a LOT of that weight is the watery juice from the tomatoes and thus I was unpleasantly surprised to see how little of that 26.46 oz is actually TOMATOES. So one day I took the time to strain the package and see exactly how much chopped tomato there is, versus their juice. The strained chopped tomato pieces were weighed on my electronic kitchen scale and came to 13.4 oz; the juice which was strained directly into a measuring cup came to just below the 11 fluid oz mark. Also, some of that 13.4 oz of chopped tomatoes also included a little bit of juice as well, since they were impossible to drain completely ""dry"". So this means that for the current price ($2.50 per box of Pomi at my local supermarkets) you are getting only about 13 oz of chopped tomatoes. That comes to about 19 cents per ounce. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br />This made me curious enough to invest in a ""throwaway"" can of my former choice, the Del Monte Petite Cut tomatoes which comes in a 14.5 oz can, to see how they compared. I strained it in the same manner as I did the Pomi. The results: I got 12 oz of actual tomatoes and only 2.5 oz of their juices. The can of Del Monte was $1.29 (at the same large supermarket chain that sells the Pomi for $2.50) which comes to 10.7 cents per ounce... almost half the cost of the Pomi if you are calculating how much actual chopped tomatoes you get for the money.<br /><br />I must also comment that the consistency of the Pomi chopped tomatoes is much ""mushier"" than the Del Monte petite cut or other typical canned ones ... in fact, IMHO the Pomi chopped is more than halfway to ""sauce"" consistency right out of the box, which is okay for some recipes but not good for others. The Del Monte diced served me perfectly in that regard but again... that darned BPA in their cans! :-(<br /><br />I really DID want to love the Pomi chopped tomatoes and if it was only the taste and the consistency that disappointed, I could probably learn to live with those shortcomings. However the realization that they cost almost twice the price for approximately the same quantity of ACTUAL chopped tomatoes compared to the equivalent canned product, is very frustrating especially in today's economy. Because I usually need little or none of the juice which makes up more than 35% of the package's contents, basically I'm paying a 90% premium for the non-BPA packaging.<br /><br />There should really be a better alternative but I've yet to find it. The few tomatoes in glass jars that I have found, have all contained spices (which I can't use, being allergic to garlic and onion) or have high sodium contents. Ideally, I wish Pomi would add a straining step to this product (which perhaps Del Monte does?) so that their package would contain more tomatoes and less liquid.",3
"I am a regular matcha drinker, and have been buying matcha from Mitsuwa or Sunrise Mart NYC for years, but bought this Republic of Tea matcha at the local Whole Foods. The colour of the tea is nothing like in the image on the package, it is a dull green (which means more oxidation and stems). There are usually three qualities of matcha: ceremonial, universal, and culinary. I am giving this tea 1 star because it is culinary quality at best. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />If you want good matcha, is best to try the universal quality Maeda-En (gold package). Or if you want to splurge, try the ceremonial (black package) quality, both for sale here on amazon or straight from the Maeda-en Website.",1
"First impressions of IZZE Pomegranate (that's a funny word if you say it too many times):<br /><br />Attractive packaging and accurate descriptions on the labels with one exception. On the logo side of the can it says ""Pure Fruit Juice"", and I know this is childish, but then it says ""& sparkling water fortified with vitamins."" Well, that's hardly pure fruit juice. It has other stuff in it too. However, IZZE Beverages redeem themselves by actually not adding refined sugars or caffeine to the drink. This is something I can give to my children and not worry about Child Protective Services hunting me down. I was surprised to see that pomegranate (funny word!) is not the main ingredient. It's sixth on the list. Apple, white grape, clarified pineapple, lemon, cranberry and then pomegranate (teehee). I guess ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" sounded better to the marketing department than ""Bubbly Clarified Pineapple Juice"" (not funny sounding at all, which is also a definite negative in my personal selection of a thirst-quenching beverage).<br /><br />Taste. This is the good part. It's clean with a little sweet-tartness. Very nice balance and engages quite a few taste buds. It's fizzy and crisp. It kind of reminds me of the grape juice that I used to sneakily drink during church as a child, but with vitamin C, Niacin and B6. It has a nice, easy after taste that is not offensive like a few other drinks in this category.<br /><br />The profits. The company claims to be in partnership with the Global Education Fund ""to help provide educational opportunities and resources to needy children around the world."" And there's a kicker.<br /><br />The kicker: A lot of companies tout their philanthropic ventures. But with IZZE it appears that they actually do benefit humankind through a compassionate capitalism. The put their money to work! Employees, if the report is true, actually donate personal time for fund raisers and collect books in an IZZE vehicle. Those books are sent internationally to orphans and other needy children for their educational benefit. If you are involved with a school, you can partner with the Global Education Fund and do the same thing as IZZE. They are also involved in improving the ""quality of life for children with chronic and life-threatening medical conditions"" and programs promoting environmental responsibility and there's even more. Wow.<br /><br />And my two-year old loves it. She found a new treat. And now I have a new reward for positive behavior! bwahahahaha [pirate laugh]<br /><br />Great drink. Great company. I'm sold.",5
"I was really surprised that our dog actually seemed to like this.  Usually, he is extremely picky about his food, and he normally does not like anything not chicken.  However, he seemed to enjoy this.  I thought that was great, until I checked out the ingredients.  While beef is listed first, which is important, the two next listed are soy and soy by products.  While they do have value as proteins, the value is no where near that of real meat, and the price per ounce is higher than what I pay for a dog food with lots more real protein value.  When it comes to dog food, all protein is not created equal.  If your dog is larger or a working breed, this food really will not give him the best protein bang for your money.  Most of the other ingredients are filler and empty calories. I think the coloring is a real poor choice.  The artificial chemicals used in coloring dog food are really just added to make the human consumer feel that the food is better balanced and has more variety, the color has no positive impact on the health of the dog.  I prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients.  Not to mention that with the higher price per ounce, it is less filling and the dog will want to eat even more of it to fill the need for real protein.  While it may taste good to him, I would rather give him healthier food that is a better deal money wise and health wise.  I will let him eat it, since he does seem to enjoy it, but I am thinking of it more as a treat type item, and definitely not a regular part of his diet.",2
"My aunt has twelve dogs at her huge hilltop property.  Over the years, I've grown to love the dogs like my own.

"This bagged dry dog food ""presents"" very nicely . . . no disagreeable dog food odor, visible chewy meat and vegetable nuggets, and apparently an excellent taste that dogs enjoy.<br /><br />We normally feed our Jack Russell and Chihuahua using a feeder that allows them access to food 24/7.  However, with this Chef Michael's Grilled Siroin Dry Dog Food, I'm forced to ration it out in suitable serving sizes to each dog to prevent overeating (the same routine I would use for table scraps).  Notwithstanding the overfeeding caution, I trust Purina (the maker of Chef Michael's) as a reputable pet food manufacturer and have no concerns with nutritional or health issues here.  Combine that with the apparent great taste and this is a 5 star product in my opinion.<br /><br />If I may add further opinion regarding the quality of this product and the variety of reviewer responses -- I see that many reviewers took issue with the ingredients list, finding most of the ingredients to be inferior, undesirable, or harmful.  I guess I'm a bit more economically frugal in my views.  As this is a relatively expensive dog food, I don't mean frugal price-wise, but rather resource-wise.  OF COURSE by-product meats and some vegetable filler (which does have nutritional benefit) are used.  I find it acceptable and even expected that the meat and fat products used in this DOG FOOD would come from animals that are in-part legally unsuitable for humans  (although in other parts of the world they would be consumed by humans). In fact, nothing in the animal slaughter industry goes to waste and the ingredients in this pet food product are far from the bottom of that usage ladder.  Unacceptable are the synthetic pet food products such as we have imported from China that have actually killed our pets or ruined their kidneys.  Acceptable, in my opinion, are pet foods (such as this Chef Michael's branded product) made by a reputable experienced manufacturer using by-products and vegetable products known as suitable for pets.<br /><br />Anecdotally, I recall growing up on a farm where our Labrador loved to kill and eat groundhogs . . . it sometimes took a few days to finish one . . . in the summer.  Burying didn't help, as she would dig them up.  Anyway,  the dog loved the disgusting decaying groundhogs, which would have violated pet food laws and sensitivities on many fronts.  She lived long and healthy.  And happy.",5
"It took about ten seconds to realize that this product tastes great to my dogs.  We have a lab and a pug, and both of them attacked their bowls like I'd given them steak.  I'm sure they weren't happy when I went back to ""boring"" Hill's the following day, but this isn't a product I'd recommend for keeping any dog healthy.<br /><br />The reason I've only given this product four stars is that many of the ingredients aren't something I want my dogs eating regularly.  They don't have many problems with soy, but I know a lot of other dogs do.  They (and I) do have problems with the heavy use of corn, the always-worrisome chicken by-product, and artificial colors.  That last one seems like an obvious admission from the makers of this product that they're really targeting dog owners more than they are dogs.  My lab certainly wasn't awestruck by the various colors on the package.<br /><br />My feeling is that this is a nice treat or occasional meal-topper for my dogs, but it won't be something I purchase for daily consumption.  Both dogs certainly love the taste, and I commend Chef Michael for that, but for long-term health I'd recommend other options.",4
"Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this ""food"" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, ""What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?""  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior.",1

The whole thing, from initial order to 2nd delivery receipt took no more than a week and a half.<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />Oh yeah, and the product itself is unquestionable.  Arguably the best coconut water out there.  Btw, go with plain--there's no reason to get added flavors to muck up the real thing.",5
"I'm an olive addict - it's officially a sickness. Granted there was only one review for the product but the line got good reviews in general. What a letdown. Received three jars, opened one and olives were mushy with an odd ""off"" taste. Second jar was same, off taste, smell and mushiness. I almost threw third jar away unopened but I'm stubborn and I paid a lot for these damn olives! Finally, a decent olive - not great but some proper olive taste, nice brine and crispness. For the cost/shipping I feel ripped off. It's like they sent two bad jars and one good. I won't ever order these from Amazon again. In fact Gristede's carries Mezzetta Martini olives and the olives and Vermouth are really delicious - not a mushy one in the bunch and the liquid makes a great dirty martini. Best, a case of six was less than this order. I've got my fingers crossed they won't be mushy when they arrive. I think the vinegar and vermouth softens the Leone olives - the Mezzetta olives are as sans vinegar. If you love olives give the Mezzetta's try.",2
"We gave this to our one month old son until yesterday, and then found out that the formula we have been giving him since birth was recalled.  He wasn't doing too well on it.

We will never trust or go back to the Similac brand (any type).",1

"After decades of never touching an ounce of chocolate milk, Horizon converted my husband to chocolate milk so intensely that he now goes through his carton in the fridge faster than I go through mine.  I have had to resort to putting my name on one container and his on another so that he doesn't drink mine too (I am a lifelong chocolate milk fan and this is my favorite brand).  This size, by contrast, is ideal for him to carry to his work fridge or alongside him when he is going elsewhere. Although the sugar content may be high, I've discovered this milk pretty much eliminates the need for both of us to wolf down chocolate bars.  So we are both getting a lot more calcium and protein, plus reduced fat, than we were with our chocolate bar binges.",5

"Velveeta cheese really is not my cup of tea..and the seasoning packet added a another flavor that seemed artificial and chemically to me. I am not that fussy either, I love Kraft Mac n'Cheese and the occasional Hamburger Helper so I am not a food snob. This was just not very appealing in flavor.",2
"I used to have Hamburger Helper (HH) as a kid.  But when I became an adult, I bypassed the HH for something cheaper, making cheese sauce myself.  So I usually make a roux and then add pasta to it.  This meal is better tasting then I thought it would be.  It comes with a spice pack, cheese sauce pack and pasta.  You supply the meat.  I personally wouldn't buy the product for $2.50 a box when I can buy a bag of pasta on sale at my local supermarket for $1, then add spices already in my cupboard and then make a roux, which yes, takes 30-40 minutes instead of the 20 here.  I have no kids and my boyfriend and I have time to cook, so time isn't too tight for us.  Even with a a dollar or two of real cheese added to my recipe, I'd rather know what I am eating for $3 (which really would make twice as much pasta as the pasta that came in the box) then eat something loaded with odd ingredients I don't know.<br /><br />Despite this, the skillet meal is easy to prepare, even an older kid could probably do this and it would save time for busy adults.  It tastes ok. The spice gives it a Mexican sort of appeal and I ate it as shown on the back of the box, with shredded lettuce and onion.  I do think that most of the money you pay for this item goes into packaging and the design of the box.  Since I am not eating the box, I'll stick to my own cheese sauces, thanks!<br /><br />Note:  I did use very lean beef for this meal and it came out rather cheesy, which was a good thing.",3
The New Cheesy Skillet by Velveeta is a simple and quick meal that will feed your entire family. I enjoyed how easy this dish was to prepare and you didn't need to add much to the dish to create a full yet satisfying meal. I loved the fact that Velveeta didn't put in a powdered cheese product but instead used creamy Velveeta that created the perfect dish.<br /><br />The Hamburger helpers are a bit too salty for my taste but this product didn't over salt the product and this made it that much better. I will definitely purchase this product in the future as an easy dish for my family on those hectic days.,5
"Being a house with two big sons, having some meals be easy to prepare and inexpensive is essential.  But it also has to taste good!  This fits both bills and as an added bonus, it doesn't contain the mysterious sulfites that sometimes leave me feeling like my inside are wringing themselves with some other products.  My sons took to this immediately and cooked it up and devoured it.  This is definitely an upgrade to the other ""helper meals"".  This one is much cheesier and tastier.",5
"Tastes just okay for the price, just a bit too strong though.. But boy oh boy does this coffee stink! It has a very strong smell of tobacco, I have this coffee double bagged and in a cabinet, but can still smell it.

"What a disaster! What nerve they have! They label this mess ""Chicken and Broccoli"" but there's no chicken in it. There's almost no broccoli in it, either. You get a teeny tiny pouch with some green dust in it, that they have the nerve to label ""broccoli florets"".<br /><br />Besides that, the little pasta bits have no taste or texture. Then you drown your meat that you added and everything else in a mass of tasteless cheese sauce that has all the calories and sodium of cheese and none of its good qualities (like flavor).<br /><br />What an expensive way to ruin some perfectly good meat.<br /><br />Step 1 in preparing this is to fry up the chicken. Stop right there, hand me the chicken between two slices of bread, and I'll be a whole lot happier, plus saving the cost of this disaster.",1

Whatever magic ACV has, if I start getting fatigued during an intense workout, a sip from a bottle of this acts like some sort of reset and lets me keep going, amazing stuff.

"I give my two small dogs a spoon of pumpkin every night - the vet recommended it and they love it!  The quality and taste of this product seems to be fine for them - they eat it without complaint.  However, the issue is that more than half of the cans were SEVERELY dented.  Since the box was intact and whole, the cans were clearly already in this condition when placed in the box and shipped.  Because of the degree of denting on the cans, I could only safely use about 2/3 of the package.  Big picture - great product but you are being shipped cans the store won't sell because of the denting.  If you can accept that not all cans will be usable, this is good product.  But I was disappoint by the condition of the cans and will not repurchase this item.",2
"This stuff is great! I switched my 8 week old female GSD puppy to this about a week after I got her (the breeder gave me a bag of the food she was feeding her dogs...I think it was IAMS...) and immediately she had no more problems with diarrhea. In addition, I also sprinkle on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003153TEA"">Missing Link 8-Ounce Puppy Health Formula</a> and ""Schatzi"" loves it! I had no proof that these items worked well together until I visited the breeder when my puppy was ~4months old. The breeder still had one of my puppy's sisters (from the same litter), and there definitely was a noticeable difference between their coats. The ingredient's include copper proteinate and copper sulfate, which is probably why my puppy's coat was MUCH more glossy and her color's are more pronounced. The first bag lasted about a month, and I have already bought my second bag, which isn't bad for ~ $1.75/day -especially with the prime/free 2 day shipping option. She really likes this food and never leaves anything behind, and I will continue to buy!",5

"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item. For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.",5
"You need to try this cereal in order to form your own opinion.  I eat this cereal every single day for breakfast.  It is my favorite cereal and I absolutely love it!  I have never thought the chocolate tasted waxy.. I make sure to eat every last chocolately piece in my bowl.  My husband doesn't like it, and I buy the Vanilla Almond for him, and I've talked to other people who don't like it, but my personal opinion is that it is absolutely yummy.  They usually have it on sale at Rite-Aid for 2 for $5 every couple weeks or so, and that is when I stock up on it.",5
This was a great value. My growing family of four boys goes through a lot of peanut butter and I'm happy when I can get a good deal on it. Skippy is a brand I trust and the peanut-y taste is a hit with all the kids. Great in recipes too.,5
Good coffe at a very good value. Tried others but will stick with this one. Tried Agee others but stuck with this one.,4
"came in good time.  but the bars were stale. Very disappointing, considering how expencive they are!!!",2
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
"I tried the grape first and loved it so I decided to try these.  They are just ok, but my kids won't eat them.  Oh well, I'll finish this case but won't buy this kind again.",3
"I've been using Marshmallow Fluff for many years and especially like using it in icing recipes. Sure you can just eat it straight from the bottle by the tablespoon which I've been guilty of doing on occassion. I hear people put it on toast but what I really think it was made for was to make Whoopie Pies.<br /><br />Two baby-sitters taught me to make a similar recipe when I was 8 years old and I have never forgotten it. Black cocoa is used to darken the cake. King Arthur flour from the Baker's Catalogue is essential to the flavor and texture. The not-too-sweet cake develops more flavor and is balanced by the rich icing.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE WHOOPIE PIES<br /><br />Chocolate Cake<br /><br />  1/2 cup Hershey's or Van Leer Dutch-process cocoa<br />  1 tablespoon Dutch-process black cocoa<br />  1 cup fat-free milk, warmed to 130<br />  1 cup low-fat buttermilk<br />  1/2 cup corn oil<br />  2 large eggs<br />  1 cup golden brown sugar<br />  1 cup dark brown sugar<br />  1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br />  3 1/2 cups King Arthur all-purpose flour<br />  2 teaspoons baking soda<br />  1/2 teaspoon salt<br /><br />Vanilla Frosting<br /><br />  1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened<br />  3 cups confectioners' sugar<br />  3 tablespoons half-and-half<br />  1/2 teaspoon colorless double-strength vanilla<br />  1 cup Marshmallow Fluff<br /><br />1.  Preheat the oven to 350 .<br /><br />2.  Cake batter: In a large bowl, use a mixer on low speed to<br />  beat cocoa, black cocoa and milk. Beat in the buttermilk, oil,<br />  eggs, golden brown sugar, dark brown sugar and vanilla.<br />  Measure the flour, baking soda and salt into a sifter. Sift over<br />  the batter, then beat batter on low for 2 minutes.<br /><br />3.  Cover baking sheets with baking parchment. Use a 1/4 cup<br />  measuring cup and spatula to scoop up batter and drop it onto<br />  a baking sheet. If the batter won't stay in place add up to 1/2<br />  cup more flour to make a thick batter which holds its shape<br />  when dropped onto the baking parchment and only spreads to<br />  a 4-inch diameter round. I don't advise premeasuring onto the<br />  parchment. Just measure and bake for the best results.<br /><br />4.  Swirl batter with spatula to make a round pie. You will fill<br />  three baking sheets at about six rounds a sheet. In between<br />  scooping the batter, set the measuring cup in a 1/2 cup size<br />  measuring cup to keep things from getting messy.<br /><br />5.  Bake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cakes are done<br />  when tops bounce back when pressed. Cool completely.<br /><br />6.  Frosting: In a deep medium bowl, beat butter and sugar on<br />  low speed. Beat in the half-and-half and vanilla, then<br />  Marshmallow Fluff. Continue beating frosting for<br />  one to two minutes or until fluffy.<br /><br />7.  Spread frosting on cakes, then sandwich together and pile on a<br />  large plate. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar in a sifter.<br /><br />  Hint: For a kid's birthday party, make miniature pies by<br />  using tablespoonfuls of batter. Pies may be made days ahead<br />  and frozen. Set them out on the counter to thaw and then frost<br />  before serving. To quick thaw, watch carefully in microwave.<br /><br />  Makes 9 or more whoopie pies<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, who loves to bake",5
"This is so good, Surprisingly good, and it gets even better with age. I added the whole package of sugar into the brew with the dry malt ""Oops,I didn't read all instructions"", The instruction recommended 300g and I used 1kg, But it turned out awesome, just more alcohol.<br />So far this is my 4th brew, and I have been very happy with all Coopers products.",5
"(NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: ""Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled ""Bad"" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives.""<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!",1
I expected these to taste like pecan pie.  They taste more like date nut bars.,3
"Fenugreek works for some moms and doesn't for others. I find it utterly amusing that women talk about smelling like maple syrup while taking the supplement!! I haven't noticed that - either I'm used to it or my husband is too nice to tell me, or he has noticed and likes it! I was making just enough to feed my little one, and now I regularly pump 1-2 ounces AFTER he eats AND I pump in between feedings and get an ounce or so.. That doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up and I've started quite the nice freezer stash. I'm not honestly sure if it was the fenugreek that has done it or if my body just started producing more because my diet is great and I stay hydrated.. But since fenugreek is a hell of a lot cheaper than the Motherlove products and not as annoying with the restrictions about drinking around taking the pills, I'm just gonna keep taking them!<br />Also, I have had no problems with gassiness in baby.",5
"WOW!  This is the best popcorn topping I have bought to date, and I am a popcorn junkie!  It contains coconut oil just like they use in the theaters.  Label also lists milk and soy.  I tried this two different ways when it arrived last night.<br /><br />First I tried it on the stove.  Heated up just a little oil and put the kernels and about 2tsp of salt in a measuring cup.  Once the oil was added I threw the kernels and salt in, covered it, and it produced movie theater style/quality popcorn.  I put some of the topping in a salt shaker to top.<br /><br />Second, I air popped some kernels, sprayed them with canola oil and shook some of the topping on with a salt shaker.  Not as good by any standard, but much healthier and among the best ""buttery"" air popcorn I've had without pouring a ton of butter on.<br />The jug will last me well beyond its expiration date, it's a LOT of topping.  For the price with the Amazon Prime shipping I couldn't be happier with this.  If any of my friends make popcorn I'm going to give them some of this to use, IT'S AWESOME BUTTERY SALTY GOODNESS.<br /><br />Also not too bad on veggies if you like that salty buttery flavor.",5
"I was looking for a healthy trail mix and this product was recommended by a fitness trainer.  In addition, I've also learned the makers of this product go above and beyond the USDA standards of 'Organic labeling'.  I have placed my 2nd order (actually have this on auto ship!) and am looking forward to its arrival.  This is by far the healthiest trail mix I have found.  It's full of wonderful surprises and is incredibly palatable!  I often share this product with my friends, and now several of them are on hooked on it as well!",5
"I just researched about the korean noodle recall because I love this Shin Ramyun noodle -- the best taste and texture instant noodle I have ever tasted.

I drink all kinds of different kcups during the weekday including the ones I create myself. But on the weekends I have the ultimate treat for myself with the double black diamond. It is my favorite of all the kcups!!!!!  I love the value of the 96 count box. It fits my budget very well.,5
"I was looking for a bunch of different options for on-the-go lunches that would not require a refrigerator. I ended up getting a pack of these Easy-Mac to-go cups since I loved easy-mac as a kid. They worked out pretty well!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy - very simple instructions, no additional stuff needed (except about a cup of water). Following the instructions on the pack yields the exact advertised product<br />2) Quick - 3.5 minutes in the microwave!<br />3) Similar to stove-top Easy Mac - taste is very similar to the stove-top version. Though consistency is not (see below).<br />4) ample cheese sauce - my gripe with Easy Mac is that sometimes it lacks in the cheesiness (compared to other quick-type macaroni and cheeses such as velveta). This comes with a pretty good size pack of cheese mix, and definitely carries through in execution.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) noodles are a bit mushy - This is obviously not fresh, homemade pasta,  and the noodles are a little mushy after cooking in a microwave on high power. Doesn't particularly bother me though, but if you're a pasta snob (cough, Scott Conant, cough), you may wanna steer clear.<br />2) Takes a while for sauce to thicken - The instructions require that you add the cheese sauce mix after you microwave the pasta alone. Then you stir for a while until the cheese sauce thickens to your liking. It will take a while. In my experience, expect to face an additional 5-7 minutes of stirring the hot pasta with sauce before it thickens to the traditional consistency of Easy Mac (ie. macaroni and cheese).<br />3) Small portion - I'll admit, this is probably an item that is targeted for children, but in any case, it's a fairly small portion. More of a snack than a meal. Then again, I don't think I'd really like an entire meal of Easy Mac...<br /><br />Overall, it's a small pack that's easy to throw in my bag on days I don't have access to a fridge to keep my lunch cold. It's quick, easy, and requires no additional items to make (again, aside from water). If ever I need this kind of item again, I will definitely purchase!",4
"This product has a nice flavor, and no MSG or nitrates based on the label.  As another reviewer pointed out, it's a bit on the sweet side but I enjoyed that.  But, and yes I know jerky is dried meat obviously, I found this product to be very dry, a bit too dry and tough.  The thicker pieces were in fact hard for me to bite through and chew.  I'll still enjoy this jerky, but it could be a lot more tender, and I've had tender jerky made with no MSG or nitrates in the past from other companies.<br /><br />If you like very tough jerky, I suppose raise this to a four or five star review for you.",3
The micro salt was not really powder.  The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on  a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.,1

I prefer hazelnut flavored coffee and used instant Taster's Choice brand until they stopped packaging it in the 6 or 7 oz canisters.  After experimenting with various flavoring agents I found this Torani syrup to fill the bill.  Don't add any sugar or sweetener as the syrup is already sweet.  Personally I am very happy with the results.  I have my hazelnut instant coffee again at a reasonable price.,5
"I use Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla syrup daily in frozen coffee drinks as well as in oatmeal.  I am very pleased indeed.  The flavor is excellent for a sugar-free product and the larger sized bottle available from Amazon makes it efficient and economical as I now go through only one bottle about every two to three weeks (thus the three pack lasts about two months before I need more).  As always, the combination of Amazon's fast free delivery and fair price (no added taxes) makes this a highly recommended buy on an great product, plus if you want to save even more you can buy it on Amazon's subscription basis where you select the delivery frequency that suits your needs.  Torani and Amazon can't be beat for the combination of quality, reliability, and price.",5
"I usually buy orange and lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their lemon zest is great also!",5

Tried it a second time and the same thing happened - that was how I KNOW it is this coffee, not the coffee maker.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you want to risk having your expensive coffee maker break.",1
"This particular matcha tastes EXACTLY like cheesecake and not that fake cheesecake made with inferior ""cheesecake"" stuffing stuff you can buy pre made in the store but real cheesecake made at home from scratch or from a fine restaurant or bakery!<br /><br />It is not overly sweet either which I was surprised at because I honestly was expecting something more fake tasting and overly sugary.<br /><br />I was both surprised and pleased when I took my first sip and realized this was the real deal! I still am amazed that Red Leaf Tea can get such excellent flavor from all natural sources into a matcha!<br /><br />This flavor melded perfectly with the green tea base giving it a beautiful slightly sweet and creamy earthy flavor! I imagine it would be insanely good in a white base as well!<br /><br />You can almost taste the crumbly cheesecake crust in this as well as the taste of the filling so you do get that whole cheesecake experience.",5

"Indus Organics Ceylon cinnamon is the real thing. If you've never tried Ceylon cinnamon before, you should because its milder flavor blends beautifully with other ingredients without overpowering the taste of your recipes.<br /><br />Indus Organics makes Ceylon cinnamon more affordable for the average consumer. In case you didn't know, two kinds of cinnamon are sold in the U.S. There's cassia cinnamon (which is a very strong flavor and much less expensive) and then there's Ceylon cinnamon (which has a milder, sweeter flavor, but usually costs considerably more).<br /><br />I've ordered twice now from Indus Organics through Amazon and each time, my order has arrived quickly and in good shape. The 1 pound pack that I ordered the second time was a great price and enough to last for many, many months. I want to thank Indus Organic and Amazon for making true cinnamon more affordable and easily obtainable.",5

I have two yellow labs - one of which has severe food allergies (ear infections).  I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!,5
"Fee Brothers nail the summer tiki staple (a more flavorful simple syrup) often used in fruity drinks.

In drinks that ask for a winter falnurum (which is usually darker with a more mollasas flavor) this is not what you're looking for, but can be used as a substittue in a pinch.<br /><br />Unsure what to do with it?

This is the obnoxiously hot with a lot of flavor. A bottle usually lasts me a year.

Product that is unsellable to wholesalers should not be dumped on consumers via Amazon.  I would have paid more at another site rather than get a product that is ready to be thrown away.",1
I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.,1

"I have been using Raw Agave Nectar as a sweetener almost exclusively for a number of months now.  I am even enrolled in the automatic subscription program, however I am in the process of re-thinking my decision. First off, there is quite a bit of information on the Internet that points to the fact that agave nectar is really a manufactured  and not a naturally occurring product - agave syrup - and that it is really a form of high fructose syrup.  There is also a concern about the plant source and how it could be potentially harmful to some individuals.  This product is expensive, and if you use it regularly, you may find that you are using quite a bit even if it is sweeter than sugar.  And if you are using a lot, shouldn't you be concerned about what you are really ingesting?<br />Go to [...] for some insight into this.  Could it be that the sweetener that I have grown to love (and it tastes great - like a maple syrup substitute) and that I use primarily throughout the day in tea and in yogurt/kefir is worse for me or no better than table sugar?  Should I be frowning when my son uses pancake syrup and I choose to use raw agave ""nectar""?<br />I guess the old saying still rings true - if it sounds or tastes too good to be true, then maybe it just isn't as good as it appears to be.",3
GREAT ingredients but it's hard to blend. It tastes pretty good mixed with almond milk but I'm not a huge fan of the texture.,3
We've had this product before; either you like it or you don't.<br />We put a scoop in with our regular coffee and it makes such a<br /> wonderful cup of coffee!,5
"I found the Newton Fruit Thins Fig and Honey product to be very tasty. The items are cookie sized and designed to be firm rather than soft and moist. At first I was a bit turned off by this firmness as it seemed to make the cookie too dry. However, I soon found that the bits of figs that permeate the fruit thin were themselves moist enough to keep the cookie from being too dry. As a testimony to this products desirability, the people in my household consumed the cookies in less than 2 days, so I guess we all thought they were pretty good. Newton fruit thins are definitely worth giving a try. If you like your cookies on the crisp side and enjoy the taste of figs, this product is definitely for you. In fact, if you like figs but have been turned off by the soft dough on Fig Newtons, this cookie might be a good bet for you.",5
"So, just like with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA"">Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a>, I brought these into work. I have the same opinion. Yum. It's for much the same reasons too so forgive me if the review looks similar to the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor.<br /><br />These are thin, almost English tea-like cookie crackers. They're decent in the health department, with some fiber and 3 of them are 140 calories. What's nice is the balance of flavor. They are not overly sweat. The fig and honey flavors fit well together and make this another great one. I'd definitely add these to my snack list.<br /><br />What's nice here is that there is no fructose or high fructose corn syrup. There are wheat and soy based ingredients for those of you with allergies. If you are not allergic, give them a try.",5
"Didn't the ads for Fig Newtons used to say something like a ""Newton"" is sort of a cake and sort of a cookie or words to that effect?  Then why call this product ""Newtons"".  These are thin, flat, crispy cookies.  The taste is so-so.  It's okay, but I was expecting something with filling or chunks of the fruit (in this case figs).  They seem a bit dry to me but are alright with coffee.  I'm underwhelmed by the product to be honest and don't think I'd get again.",3
This gum is very minty and powerful. It gives you a little kick after you chew it for a small period of time. It does get nasty after a while of chewing tho. The gum shipped fast too.,4
I'm mostly a diet cola drinker because I've never found a diet ginger ale that didn't taste terrible.  But I miss an occasional one and decided to try the Zevia brand.  Excellent!  Fills a gap that somehow other diet ginger ales can't.,5
"I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.  We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food.  The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them!  I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients.  It makes no sense.  More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either.  The hunt is on to find the next ""great food""...",1
I love this product and eat it every morning in my smoothie.  I am full until lunch time and have lost weight in a healthy way since using this product.,5
this is the worst tasting pumpernickel bread i have ever tried to eat. we gave it to numerous other people and absolutely nobody would eat it. even the dogs wouldn't touch it my review is minus 100 stars it is the worst of the worst.,1
The Sparkling Ice drink tastes very good and is a nice change from cola.  It is sugar free and good for a diabetic to drink.,5
"Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.",3
"We have one of the smaller 4 foot Nostalgia popcorn kettle poppers and the kettle doesn't seem too big and finding popcorn portions for it is not as easy as I had thought. Amazon to the rescue! -- I found these smaller portion packets (2.5 oz) and these packets seem to do the trick.  The popcorn was very good - just the right amount of salt and butter flavor.  No fault of the popcorn itself but rather the popcorn popper, I concluded that 2.5oz of popcorn is not nearly enough popcorn for 2 or 3 people, especially when 6-7 percnt of the kernels never pop (again blaming the machine) and I usually end up having to make two - 2.5 oz servings for 3 people. Thats when the novelty of making concession style popcorn can get pricey.<br /><br />With free shipping this is one of the best deals around. I would recommend it to others and suggest that they try one box and determine if the taste is satisfying to their palete, if its not for you, you can always send me the unused packs and switch to microwave popcorn at a fraction of the cost.",5
When I received my shipment one bag was completely crushed.  Surprising since all of the bags were surrounded by packing bubbles.  I contacted the company regarding a return and it took two emails before I received an email back that promised I was receiving a replacement shipment in 3 - 4 business days along with a return label.  That was on November 1st.  It is now November 22nd.  I emailed them one more time last week asking where my replacement order was and have not heard back from them.  I will not be buying from them again.,1
"Lets just say that I love this tea so much, I got my husband (who drank only coffee), and several family members hooked on to it as well (I drink it with green tea & honey)! It is especially great for colds & cough. I even give it to my 3 year old when she is sick. My husband was initially concerned about giving it to her, but I showed him that it has all natural ingredients...pretty much the same ingredients I'd use to make her a homemade concoction, and I really don't steep it for too long in hers, making it milder (along with honey). I don't believe in using medicines too much, and so I'm always looking out for naturally curable alternatives for any kind of sickness. Needless to say that I get these boxes shipped on a bi-monthly basis.",5
I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.,5
Slight peanuty taste. Does not taste at all like authentic peanut butter but when used with sugar free jelly suffices your craving for peanut butter taste with no calories especially if you are on a diet.,3
Been buying this for several years and never been disappointed. Next best thing to your favorite waffle house!,5
"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.",4
organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.,4
"Although it is called peas, these are not peas, it is a bean. The outer shell is harder than most beans and when the pigeon peas are cooked the smell of lemon/lime will be there for hours to come although the beans do not have the taste of lemon or lime at all.",3
"I'm not a vegetarian, but I am a potato chips addict. Recently I decided to start eating less processed food, stay away from gluten, lower my sodium intake, and avoid transfats completely. Although I now snack on carrots, celery, and radishes, I still love chips. So I was astounded to discover Naturals Garden Veggie Crisps, which meet most of my requirements for real, healthy food. The question: how do they taste? Their flavor is more subtle than conventional chips and even whole veggies, but I think they're darned good! Try them for what they are, not for what they aren't!",5
"You never know when a small amount of hi quality paste will be needed and this fit's the bill perfectly every time.  Very handy and accesible, just throw the partially used tube in the fridge for next use.",4
"I thought the flavor was decent, but that it just reminded my husband and I too much of something we would buy at our local gas station. This specific K-cup only makes a very small cup before turning into just dumping water, and therefore was never sufficient for my husband to drink. I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as it seems that others are having some similar feelings!",3
this is really good like others are saying just like the gas station ones. but alot cheaper I use two for a large togo cup<br />but again it is really good.,5
"A friend of mine gave me several of these Grove Square Cappuccino French Vanilla k cups!! Just loved them, but could not find them available in any local store. She told me she got them from Amazon.com. We fix it with a little bit of cream whip on top! Tastes just like you bought it from a coffee shop. Have ordered more, so I never run out. You will not be sorry if your purchase this item. I did order and try the Hazelnut, liked it but not as much as this.",5
"LOVE this product!  Wish it would come in a fat free version!  Delivery was great and it smells GREAT! YUMMY, delicious and my hubby enjoys it too!",5
"I have had a really difficult time getting my dogs to eat dog food:  one had to be on a special homemade diet for 6 months, after which no kibble would make the grade.  Fortunately, this one worked, although I do take extra measures for my incredibly picky dogs, including crushing it, adding warm water, heating it in the microwave, and mixing it with ground beef.  Avoderm is a healthy food that I trust, and the other reviewer with concerns about avocados need not worry:  it's the stems and leaves of the avocado that are a problem for dogs, not the meat of the fruit itself.  I will keep buying as long as they make it.",5
"I bought this item since it has good reviews but it was not delivered as what other people described. The package was shipped by a USPS prioity envelop, not in a box.  When it was arrived, it was partically torn; many chocolate coins got deformed already, and some were melted even though the seller put a cool pack inside. I didn't want to pass these defected ones out for our baby shower, so we ended up with preparing something instead.  Besides, they tasted waxy.  We were glad we ended up with not giving out these to our guets.",1
love the sauce. excellent for making shrimp sweet and sour recipe. i am pleased that amazon carries this product. would definitely buy again.,5
I was hoping these would be better than chocolate Twizzlers but they taste like something entirely different.  Maybe its just me and they will appeal to others.  They do not taste like chocolate at least not to to me!  The service was great I got them in 48 hours. Kenny I am sure your other flavors are good - they just do not compare to the name brand or my tastes!,2
I love this product but you have to be aware that it is fatally toxic to dogs.  Don't make cookies or something and let them get to it.<br /><br />This price looks especially great in this 5 lb pack--less than $5/pound.{plus shipping},5
"These taste like cookies, but they're not overly unhealthy for you.  The best part is that each package is only 100 calories.  If you typically eat healthy food, they will feel like a treat, but compared to, say, a milkshake, you're not going to be impressed.<br /><br />I like keeping one of these in my purse or my car if I need something sweet but don't want to overindulge.",5
"I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make ""lattes"" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.",5
received product promptly on time and in good order. i need a bunch of sour cream to put this order in order.a bag of dorito's are in additional order. watching tv with a bag of chips and plenty of dip is a good thing.,5
"I've had Creme Brulee in restaurants before and always thought it was a take or leave it dessert. Tonight, I had some of the Dean Jacob's Creme Brulee at a friend's house and am now addicted! This is a must have because it saves time and energy for just a few dollars! I would have never known this was from a mix!",5
"I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.",5
"I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!",5
Be warned - if you are looking for real tea with balck current - this is not it,3
"I haven't really found a good SF chocolate syrup yet.  The Torani is miles better than Hershey's SF chocolate syrup, though.<br /><br />This syrup is okay, especially in iced coffee or added to a something that needs a ""boost"" like plain vanilla pudding, protein shakes or low-fat brownies.  It doesn't have a strong chocolate flavor, but it is pleasantly sweet.  I couldn't taste any strong chemical after taste, like I can with some other SF chocolate products.  Not enough to satisfy a real chocoholic, but not bad, either.  I'm gonna keep looking for a really tasty SF chocolate syrup.",3
I have tried the Chocolate and Vanilla and just love the Chocloate the best.  I didn't care to much for the Vanilla.,5
"Product arrived very timely and well packed, with a generous (may 2008) use by date. Customer service from supplier was excellent.",5
"I don't buy these because they are organic, I buy them because they taste SO good! My favorite is the Vanilla Bean with Green Tea. They taste much better than Oreos. The cookie part is softer and these don't leave a shortening-greasy film/taste in your mouth. These taste like cookies from when I was a kid; no chemicals.<br /><br />If you've never had the Late July cookies before, give them a try. Yummy!",5
"I have tried many OOlong teas and this is by far the best.  It has a wonderfully light coconut, mango flavor.  The two flavors blend well together, neither one overpowering the other.  I will definitely buy again.",5
"I had no problems with their unusual cups working in the Kuerig.  The coffee was good, nothing remarkable but enjoyable.  I do plan to try some of the other San Francisco blends.  It's certainly worth a try.",3
"My mixed terrier is very particular about her treats. If she doesn't like it, she'll take it, then drop it. If she likes it (rare), she'll take it and eat it right on the spot. If she loves it (very rare), she'll take it, hide it, and then act paranoid that you saw her hide it. So then she'll go get it and re-hide it multiple times until she's satisfied that you're not spying on her with a secret wish to devour  it the moment she blinks. Then she'll sneak it out once most of the family has gone to sleep so she can savor it in peace. So I can't really tell you where today's Lamb Trachey Chewz treat went, but I can be certain she loves it! Thanks to Clear Conscience Pet for producing a healthy, greatly desired treat!",5
"I have been looking for a good, organic tea but I just did not like the taste of this one.  It feels like it leaves a film in your mouth.",2
This coconut water taste so bad...never try this product again...!!! Shared this coconut water with family members they also return it back to me after their first zip...,1
"This is the first time I tried Octavia White Tea.  After I opened the can, it looked O.K.  The whole leaves looked fairly fresh.  However, as I consumed about one third of the can, I started to see significant amount of yellowish chips and tiny flowers.  In addition, more broken tea leaves were found deeper in the can.<br /><br />I then poured out the entire can of white tea leaves to examine.  I was surprised to see how much impurities were buried in the tea leaves.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not seen that much impurities in a whole leaf tea of any kind (white, green, or black). To me, the tea farm did not do a good job in handling the tea leaves.  I would strongly question the claim of USDA Organic rating of this tea.<br /><br />If you never tried white teas before, please do not assume that the yellowish flowers and chips are part of the white tea.  They are not since this tea is Silver Needle.<br /><br />I had to remove all the impurities by hand-picking all the whole tea leaves and discarding the broken ones and the yellow flowers and chips.  I still question how this tea could be so badly handled by the tea farmer or the tea exporter/importer.<br /><br />I am sure there are better white teas out there.  Tea lovers should share more information on their findings on the many different brands.",2
"Although this product is a little pricey... It is SO WORTH IT! Prepare to fall in love! First tried it on toast... ummm! Then followed a dollop on ice cream... yummy!  My husband stopped me before I indulged beyond the point of no return, AKA not saving him any! I bought these to have on hand for the holidays...looks like I'll need to re-order! This Granite Bay Farms duo of Pecan Pumpkin Butter and Old Fashioned Apple Butter is almost too good to share - but I will! Do not hesitate to indulge in a special treat for yourself!",5
"Milkbone Original Crunchy Treats / B000EBKSCU<br /><br />My puppy just loves these Milkbone treats. Though the box says ""Great for Training"", they are a bit too big for proper treat training (which involves slicing the treats very thinly so that the dog doesn't get satiated or fattened up) because the treats are very hard and cannot be easily sliced into smaller pieces.<br /><br />However, they are uniquely good for training ""Leave It!"" - I can drop it on the floor and the puppy immediately notices the smell and comes over to investigate. And if he decides to ignore my ""Leave It!"" command, the treat is big enough and hard enough that it survives in his mouth long enough for my to reach in and grab it and start over - no rewards for ignoring ""Leave It!"", or he'll ignore it always. After only a few weeks of training, ""Leave It!"" is well-understood and almost always obeyed, thanks to these yummy Milkbones.<br /><br />Also, since these are larger and more satisfying that his usual treats, he also gets these at crate time. When Mommy says ""Crate!"" that means he snuggles into his crate and waits anxiously for his Milkbone treats. He absolutely adores them, and loves gobbling them up happily.<br /><br />These came carefully packed from Amazon with no shipping problems. The bulk price on Amazon is much cheaper than anything I've found locally and much more convenient.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",5
"Flaxseed is healthy -- but blessedly, it is also tasty.  My daughter is allergic so I substitute this product to give a nut-esque taste to fools.  I use this 'meel' to bread chicken (pound filets of chicken breasts then dip them in combo of this flaxseed, smoked paprika and salt and fry it up in a pan with safflower or coconut oil) and can make dinner fast and healthy -- and actually see it enter my children's mouths without a struggle.<br /><br />Now, if Spectrum could throw some kale 'meel' into this formula....<br /><br />As for storage, this resealable package actually does reseal which is awesome.",5
This one is not the recent style. But still good. Will not recommend this one since the new one is better. Thanks!,3
"I recently bought a 7-week-old collie puppy for my granddaughter. Joy, the puppy was taken from her mother at 2 weeks along with 9 siblings because the mother was not producing enough milk. It was the mother's first litter. The pups were hand fed a formula and were a bit small and frail for their ages though their price was not. At any rate the breeder had them on Pedigree puppy food when we purchased her and though their is nothing wrong with the brand I wanted something better for her due to her early weaning. Our 2-year-old Labradoodle is fed ""Castor & Pollux"" which really improved her coat and stamina etc. when we switched from another brand so I bought Puppy food in the same brand. However our Vet told us that she was unfamiliar with the brand, and that she wouldn't feed it to her. Instead she recommended ""Purina One Smart Blend Puppy Formula"". I of course ordered a bag and stated mixing it with the Pedigree to switch Joy over slowly so as not to upset her digestive system. She has now had Diarrhea for 4 days, her stool sample shows no abnormalities and after taking her to the vet she is being treated with medicine. On reading the list of ingredients on the bag of Purina I saw it contained something called ""ANIMAL DIGEST"". I thought ""what in the world could that be?"" On searching the Internet low and behold I discovered this web site.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />which the following came from<br /><br />""Since the pet food recalls I'd like to believe we've all grown a little more aware of what we're feeding our beloved pets. In this blog I'd like to call your attention to an ingredient that is so common in many lower quality foods and dog treats. Animal Digest is often included in many commercial treats and bottom of the barrel dog foods. Be prepared to be grossed out when I explain to you what this product really is! According to AAFCO (The term AAFCO stands for the Association of American Feed Control Officials; they provide regulatory guidelines for the manufacturing of pet foods) standards, Animal Digest is<br /><br />""Animal Digest - material which results from chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of clean and un-decomposed animal tissue. The animal tissues used shall be exclusive of hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice and shall be suitable for animal feed.""<br /><br />Yuck!<br /><br />Another expert has described Animal Digest as ""a cooked-down broth which can be made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals."" The animals can be collected from almost any source. There is no control set in place over quality or contamination. Any kind of animal can be included: ""4-D animals"" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying before slaughter), goats, pigs, sheep, horses, rats, euthanized at animal shelters, restaurant and supermarket waste, road kill, etc.<br />That is about as gross as it gets.<br /><br />Please read your bags carefully and choose treats with ingredients that you can pronounce and understand.""<br /><br />After reading this I tossed the Purina in the trash and opened the bag of Castor & Pollux. Once again an intelligent, Professional, trained person just accepted the word of an authoritative institution i.e. the ""AAFCO"" as FACT and has no doubt along with untold numbers of others in her profession recommended it to her clients to put in their pets bodies.<br /><br />This is perhaps the microcosm to the macrocosm that is today's America. We-the-People have just taken the word of all our institutions and so called leaders unquestioningly. Look where it has gotten us! I may not be able to change that unfortunate fact of human nature but I can change Joy's nutritional intake and have despite the increased cost. Sometimes you do get what you pay for. I highly recommend Amazon.com but do your dogs a favor and buy the Castor & Pollux for them or some other quality brand instead of one containing ""Animal Digest""",2
"1/4 cup muesli plus 1/2 to 2/3 cup any flavor Kefir and 1 T. Salba, stir and let sit for 30 or more min, and eat with 1/4 to 1/2 cup fresh fruit mixed in; breakfast at its best. Digestive problems solved after all these years, but it took a few months on this regimen. Have faith and stick with it. You'll be soooooooo glad you did.",5
"Walmart has it for 2.50. This has no heat what so ever, very little flavor. Will go back to tabasco sauce.",1
"Cheesy potatoes.  I didn't taste anything but the same orange cheese everyone knows from boxed dinners.  It says it has other cheeses, but I couldn't tell.  They are okay.  My family liked them more then I did.",4
"As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.",2
"Usually, I'm a fan of a very deep, dark roasted coffee, with a full-bodied, smooth flavor. This coffee is a very deep flavored mild bodied coffee. I'm usually not a fan of mild coffees but, this is one that I like to drink at night if I want a cup.<br /><br />These are individual pods, for making one cup of coffee. I like the handyness of just grabbing one to take to work to use in my single cup drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this coffee for anyone that likes a deep flavored coffee. Though, if you like a deep roasted coffee, such as a French roast you might think this one is a bit too weak for your morning java.",4
"I did a lot of research and decided to buy this food for my 4-year-old cat. I had been feeding him Royal Canin but he got fat, so I was hoping this food--without fattening grains--would help with that. (Side note: I only feed him a little bit at a time, he doesn't eat that much. But he still got fat.) When I got this and mixed it in with his old food, he didn't eat it at all, or even consider it. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or because the kibble size is very small. It falls out of his mouth. Also, compared to the other food, it doesn't not smell very attractive (to a cat, I assume). I can barely smell it at all. While I like that, my cat doesn't seem to think it's food. He did eat some last night, but he still meows at me for the other food when I try to give this to him. He picks out his old food if I mix the two. If only they could make it smell better somehow while keeping out bad ingredients, and make an adult version (bigger kibble size), then I think this would be the best food (based on ingredients).",3
I first tasted this dressing when brought back from Japan by a friend.  I have looked everywhere and it can only be found on Amazon.  It really is the best tasting dressing I have had.. By far.,5
"We bought this coffee based on all the hype (Food & Wine Magazine, ""handcrafted"" , ""Estate"" , etc)  but as serious coffee drinkers, we didn't feel this was worth the high price (especially when shipping is added). It had a pleasant, full bodied taste, but so do a lot of other, more easily available and less expensive coffees.<br /><br />Starbucks for example,  has enough different varieties of coffee where you'll find one blend very similar if not as good (or better) tasting than the much lauded Kona........just our $0.02",3
Much bigger box and bang for the buck.  I will purchase again. This is a great treat that the pups enjoy.,5
I have searched every grocery market in a fifteen mile radius and cannot find this mix.  My mom gave me a stellar Chicken Wild Rice Soup recipe and there is no substitute for Mahatma rice!  The microwave directions are easy to follow and produce a non-microwave tasting rice.  Thank you!!!,5
"Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.<br /><br />Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.<br /><br />I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way,<br />Fran B.",1
Received my order in a couple days.  The bamboo stalks were packaged well and were in good shape.  I was worried about ordering plants but was happy with how they arrived.  Would definitely order them again.,4
May be I expected too much but this is definitely processed chicken taste with a lot of salt - like canned chicken.  I have not tried any other brand but I suppose they are all the same.,2
"I bought a 6 oz jar of this conserve to try and liked it so much I almost ordered the six-pack deal Amazon has, which is very good, but then I saw this 48 - 1 oz pack and I like it a lot more because this way I can just have a serving as a treat every now and then without having an opened large jar taking space and aging away in my fridge.<br /><br />Real fruit taste and no food coloring or preservatives (no syrups, no processed sugar), just red raspberries, pomegranate, concentrated grape juice and fruit pectin.<br /><br />The texture of this delightful conserve is different from jam or marmalade, not as thick, more like between jelly and jam, and the flavor is fruitier. You can definitely taste the raspberries and pomegranate.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />The lil' jars are very useful for storing spices, individual salad dressing for the lunch box, etc., and also for non food things like beads, powders, and many other craft items.<br /><br />TIP: A few of these little jars in a cellophane bag with a nice ribbon make a lovely present.",5
"Two and a half years ago I was searching for unique, inexpensive stocking stuffer presents and I ordered these just because the label was attractive.  I was unexpectedly astonished by the superior qualities of these peanuts.<br /><br />I'm going into my third year of ordering these peanuts for myself and hubby.  I've tried other brands of Virginia Peanuts (Virginia peanuts being the most tasty of the different types of peanuts), and what I love about The Peanut Shop brand is that when they say ""lightly salted"" they truly are lightly salted. The ingredients are: Super Extra Large Virginia Peanuts, Peanut Oil, and Sea Salt.<br /><br />They taste perfectly roasted, neither undercooked nor overcooked.  And you don't get that sea salt brine aftertaste like you get with edamame (boiled young soybeans and sea salt), because the peanut taste is rich and very faintly smoky.  Do a side by side comparison of Planters cocktail peanuts with these, and you will find that the Planters are not only an inferior peanut, but they taste burned and much too salty next to the Peanut Shop Virginia peanuts.  If you love peanuts and want to spoil yourself, then order these.",5
"I bought this for my dad because he likes green tea. And most K-cup packs come assorted so I found this. I think it a bit more per K-cup than buying an assortment but if you just want green tea then this is a good buy because thats all you get. I tried one just to see how it taste and it taste like a ordinary green tea if not a little better. You arn't gonna get a super high quality green tea but it taste all right. Also if you want to stretch your money then you can do what I do and use the K-cup multiple times for a slightly lighter green tea, since it contains the leaves.",4
"My daughter follows the SCD diet for Crohn's disease.  Introducing baked goods and ""breading"" makes the diet much more manageable.  I have used it for SCD legal recipes including cookies, bread, almond milk, and breaded chicken.  All turned out very tasty and baked up very well.  It is a very fine powder and works like flour.  This site is the best price I have found.  As a note, I store mine in freezer or refrigerator to preserve freshness for a multi-week period.<br />Word to Amazon:  I agree with another user.  Selling this in 4 or 5 pound quantities would make it a better option for people who rely on this product for good health.  Purchasing 2 pound quantities just does not cut it.",5
"My 17 month old boy loves these, I don't give him as much of these as I used to since he is now into table food more than purees, but I would mix half of this in his oatmeal in the morning or if we are out, I'll use these as a snack or dessert. They are a good handy pouch to throw in your diaper bag and can sit there for days, if not weeks! I love all the ingredients in this one, baby seems to enjoy it too!",5
"I've had a lot of brownies, both from mixes and homemade and I think these may be the best brownies I've ever had. The chocolate chips melt and create little pockets of amazing. They're perfectly chewy, high quality chocolate, and just the right amount of sweet. Absolutely amazing.",5
Found this in aMiddle Eastern grocery store in Philadelphia.  The flavor is superb. I'm Italian and I know olive oil....this is delicious and adds to every dish I use it in. Best I've ever had.,5
This is a poor excuse for a gopher trap. I have lots of gophers and have used other traps. I recently bought 8 (four sets) of these traps. They are ill designed. The gophers are able to trip them without getting caught and have even managed to push the set trap out of the hole. The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.,1
"Well, unlike some of the reviewers here I know granola.<br />Good granola is hard to come by, it is even hard to make it so that it still tastes good the next day, because it requires freshness, high ratio of quality non-oat ingredients, small baking batch size, large oat size and flavor/texture variety.<br /><br />I hesitate to give this granola the accolades it deserves because I worry it will go the deplorable way of Be*r N*ked.<br /><br />I can safely say I have tried all the granola in all the stores on both West and East coasts and this Dr Flynn's Granola is probably the smartest and one of the best, up there with some of the small bakeries who make their own daily.<br /><br />How does Dr. Flynn do it, in a packaged granola from Amazon?<br />This granola is generous to a fault and has an opinion, called oily cassia.<br />Organic Saigon Cassia is not the dry cinnamon you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />Most granola is baked too fast, stingy with the good stuff and substitutes sugar for flavor, but not Dr. Flynn's Organic Granola.<br /><br />The high quality cassia cinnamon in this granola has a mind altering sweetness to it that regular stick cinnamon does not. Which means that Dr Flynn can use less sugar while giving more sweetness, and not only that, but instead of filler oats pumped full of cheap sugar, she loads it up with protein-rich pecans, almonds, cashews and coconut, wow!<br /><br />The prize goes to the cassia she found, which has more of the aromatic oils that coat and mingle gloriously well with the nutty roasty flavors in granola. It is like a healthy version of MSG, that transforms familiar flavors into the state they usually only achieve while baking. Just smell this granola, it is like opening the oven when you are baking cookies!<br /><br />Cassia also has some controversial and astonishing health effects such as a blood sugar regulating ability and anticoagulant properties.<br />With so many people suffering from blood sugar and heart disease related issues this granola, used in moderation, seems like it might be both a dangerously delicious and potentially live saving way to start the day.",5
I've asked for this flavor in three local groceries...no luck!  It's delicious...best hot after steeping for a full 5 minutes.  Thanks!,4
"I am a vegetarian, but I strive to be as vegan as possible everyday, but thus far that has proved to be way more difficult than just being vegetarian...for me at least.<br />I was really nervous to try this due to the taste some of these shakes can have. Let's face it: They are usually disgusting. Some people can handle it NO PROBLEM. Others struggle with getting it down. Some of the healthiest things to eat or drink or not always the tastiest. LOL<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that this smoothie doesn't even SMELL bad.<br />It holds true to its Tropical Citrus title & it really smells amazing.<br />I mixed 2 tablespoons with 1 cup of Silk Vanilla Almond milk & just used the spoon to mix it up.<br />It was DELICIOUS. I could not believe it.<br />It was a little bit chunky, but very small chunks. I swirled it as I went & even the small chunks I drank didn't taste bad or gritty. Just dissolved in my mouth. I think I will invest in a thermos type thing to shake it in for next time, but it isn't necessary.<br />I will be using this probably once a day, preferably in the morning, just as a drink, not a meal replacement.<br /><br />If you are skeptical, just give it a try! It really is SO delicious. & it is truly a great addition to a healthy diet! PLUS VEGAN! AND 65% RAW!",5
"Recently I attended a conference in California where smoked salmon was served as part of the breakfast buffet.  It was heavenly, and I decided to incorporate it as part of my breakfast routine.  I bought a fillet at my local grocery chain and enjoyed it greatly, but looked on Amazon for a more cost-effective approach.  This salmon is from a reputable company, but I have to say I really don't like it, compared both to the smoked salmon I had in California and from my local grocery.  It comes in a broth, and at first feels a little soft when I open the pack, but then when I eat it without the brine, it is actually quite dry.  The smoked flavor is even a little too light for my taste. Truly, I have never cared for sockeye; I've always found it dry even when not smoked, and I pay the extra for king when buying my fresh salmon. I notice other reviewers put this salmon in dips and chowders; I think that is a good solution, but I will cancel my subscription and buy smoked salmon locally for now.",2
My dog just loves this food and its a very very good canned dog food.  I will continue to purchase this product!,5
"I was a little disappointed with this particular offering from the usually wonderful Starbucks line. When I first opened the package, the smell was wonderful, but not the vanilla I was expecting - more like some other spice.<br /><br />Then when I brewed this coffee, same thing...not the vanilla I was expceting. I know Starbucks is known for its French Roast coffee, but I think the darkness of that roast overpowers the vanilla. It would have been better in a medium roast blend.<br /><br />Not a bad coffee, just not what I was hoping for.",3
"This coffee really has more of a vanilla scent than a vanilla taste. Adding a little vanilla flavoring to the pot gave it a more satisfying vanilla flavor. I was surprised to see that it is 100% Arabica beans as it is also a little bitter despite being a medium roast.<br /><br />Overall, a decent but not exciting cup of coffee without any chemical or artificial taste that flavored coffees sometimes have.<br /><br />Note that this product is not whole coffee beans but rather is already milled to what is called a ""universal grind"" which is intended for drip coffee makers.<br /><br />It seems like a long time ago that a pound of coffee was 16 oz. but I suppose that this 11 oz. ""one pound"" bag is appropriate company for those 64 oz. ""five pound"" bags of sugar and those 59 oz. ""half-gallons"" of orange juice that I have been seeing at the grocery store lately.<br /><br />I predict that 10 eggs will be sold as a ""dozen"" before long.",3
"Right when you open this bag of coffee the amazing vanilla bean smell hits you and you think, ""Man, this is gonna be a great cup of coffe!""<br />It smells like very fine whole vanilla beans that you've just split open. Unfortunately, that wonderful smell doesn't transfer to the actual cup of brewed coffee. (For full disclosure, I use a Cuisineart Auto drip) Once in your cup, the vanilla bean taste is way muted and kind of acidic.<br />On the plus side, this coffee comes ground fine, which I like. I wouldn't buy this again.",2
"Tea that at the time of blending was most likely good; but by the time you get it, it will be old; not much flavor.",2
"These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you ""dunk"" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.",5

its the king of beer. i do prefer the canned bud but bottles are ok. i can drink about 13 cans of budweiser without heaving my guts out which is more then i can say for its competitor. there labeling is beautiful and there advertisements are  near perfection.,5
"The ingredients are ""water, cane sugar, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid, natural flavors (passion fruit)"". As you probably know, the order of ingredients on these labels indicate the relative amount of each ingredient, and one sip of this will show you why sugar is the second ingredient listed: it's TOO SWEET! It's like taking a mouthful of very very sugary ice tea. I tend to prefer unsweetened ice tea so I can sweeten it myself to taste, or if it comes pre-sweetened at least it should be a small amount. This stuff is just pure sugar. Unless you have a very sweet tooth, this will probably be a problem.<br />On the plus side, the ""aloe vera"" part of the drink actually means there's actual aloe vera pulp in the tea. This may come as a surprise if you're not expecting it - and if you don't like things like high pulp OJ this is really not going to be the beverage for you. However, aloe is really good for you, and the actual pulp is the best way to get the benefits. If only they've been a little less heavy-handed with the sugar, this might have been an enjoyable drink, but I just can't get over the sweetness so this is one product I won't be buying.",2

"Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna, 15-Ounce (Pack of 2)<br />  My kids and I were divided on taste. In my opinion, the taste is on the flat or bland side with a gritty texture. I expected a burst of coconut flavor and I didn't get that at all.<br />The directions are to melt in hot water to ensure spread-ability. This was a pain in that you can't just open the jar and use the product.<br />My kids spread it on brownies and Oreo's and they loved it. I added some in a batch of pancakes which I thought was tasty and quite different.<br />Overall, I would try something else for more flavor but I think this is a quality product nonetheless and my kids really like it.",3

"These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, ""Humm these are good!""  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.",5

I purchased this in hopes that I could drink black coffee to cut the cream & sugar from my diet. It's fabulous!,5
"The coffee is smooth and very good, but I would expect more vanilla flavor from coffee that is labeled as such. It's a very light vanilla taste that I think should be amped up a little bit more! Regardless, it's still good coffee.",4
"I'm not sure exactly why I thought I'd like this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, since I usually find Starbucks coffee not to my taste. The ground coffee has a nice vanilla smell while it's still in the bag but my first sip was a huge disappointment--it tasted decidedly harsh. I tried brewing it stronger and weaker; still harsh, almost acidic. The only thing that made it drinkable was adding quite a bit of sugar, and I really don't care for my coffee that way.<br /><br />The ingredient list claims ""ground vanilla beans,"" which I wouldn't expect to have a harsh acidic taste. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world (after saffron) and grinding the beans is known to be a good way of dispersing the flavor through hot liquids. How can it have gone so wrong in this product? Is it the coffee itself that's so unappetizing, or the combination? I just don't know.<br /><br />From now on I'll look for vanilla in baked goods and body lotion, and keep it out of my coffee. Sorry, Starbucks, I'm not a fan of this brew.<br /><br />Two stars, not really for the coffee but to encourage Starbucks to do better with recycling and other green issues, and to increase fair trade initiatives.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010",2
"I love vanilla flavored coffees. In fact, until I tried this one, there wasn't a vanilla flavored coffee I'd ever tried that I didn't like. But the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee was a major disappointment. I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink.",2
My town doesn't have a Starbucks so this was my first taste. I must say it has the best brewing aroma of any coffee I have tried so far. The taste was mellow and pleasant. The vanilla is not to strong like some can be. I was very happy that they use fair trade so that the coffee growers get a fair price and the the farming methods are earth friendly.<br /><br />Another perk is when the bag is empty you can take it to a Starbucks and get a free 12 oz brewed coffee. It has to be redeemed within 30 days of the best buy date on the package.<br /><br />It's good coffee. Not a lot of fluff to say about coffee. Give it a try!,4
"Makes an excellent cup of coffee.  The vanilla flavor is not too overwhelming as to detract from the overall taste of a really good cup of coffee.  Also, a little goes a long way.

"There's no denying that coffee singles are convenient for people who don't drink coffee every day or don't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning out the coffee maker (like myself).  However, the coffee from these singles is rather bland, with not much taste and no body.  Personally, I'm not convinced that theses singles are that much better than instant coffee.  Use them for the caffeine, not the taste.",2
"The Gevalia Morning Roast is my favorite T-Disc for a few reasons:<br /><br />First, the large size.  During the week I want to fill my travel mug as I head to the bus and this disc makes the perfect size cup.  Big enough to satisfy my coffee fix but also leaves just enough room for a little milk.<br /><br />Second, it is a great mild flavor.  I'm not a coffee snob and I don't need anything fancy.  Just an easy to drink cup and this works great.  I've never had a chemical taste like another reviewer mentioned.  I like some of the Starbucks discs, but I don't think their flavor really makes them worth the extra price you need to pay - especially since you need to make two discs for one full travel mug.<br /><br />Finally, this is the disc that I have the least problems with exploding.  I like the Tassimo system in general, but I frequently have problems with grinds getting into my cup.  The Starbucks discs almost always have some sort of explosion which leads to a mess in the machine and grinds on the bottom of my cup.  I don't have that problem with this disc.<br /><br />If you are really picky about your coffee then this might not be the brew for you.  But if you just want a nice, standard large size cup then this is really great.",5

"I enjoy this tea.  However, it should be thought of more as a mint tea than a chocolate mint tea.  I was looking for a flavored Oolong tea since I prefer flavored teas and read that Oolong is much better than green for fat burning (by the way I've lost 30 pound in the last 6 months by drinking tea instead of my Starbucks mocha and removing artificial sweeteners, sugar and wheat flour from my diet so there is probably something to this). This has the potential to be a very strong tea, which I prefer.  The chocolate is most prevalent if you take the teabag early and opt for a weak tea.  Even then, it is just of hint of chocolate not a strong chocolate flavor.  As the tea sits longer, the mint and tea flavors tend to overwhelm the chocolate so there is just the barest hint left.  The mint flavor is definitely strong enough that you can sweeten with Stevia instead of sugar or artificial sweeteners and not notice anything wrong with the taste.",4

I went to Walmart first but they were sold out of poop scoopers so I ordered this one online. I have this scooper and it has done a great job for several years.

This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.",3
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
"Like Jonathan, I think this coffee is good but not to my liking as an espresso.  It lacks that ""winey"" zing.  Milder, with almost a chocolate taste.  BUT, mixed with SB's espresso - the qualities of the two make a great espresso.  Also, added half and half with regular coffee (Like Folgers) makes morning coffee come alive.",4
"This rice takes a long time to cook in my rice cooker, nearly an hour. But it holds up well and does not get mushy. The texture is wonderful. I will be reordering this rice frequently, as we have gone through three jars in a little over a month. So far, this is our favorite of the RiceSelect brand.",5
"I agree with the other reviewers.  ""Level 4 Seattle's Best"" is NOT the same as ""Henry's Blend.""  Henry's Blend was perfect, level 4 just tastes ""off.""  I'll be looking for a replacement blend.",1
"Had this over Thanksgiving 2011 for the first time. Very smooth finish even for someone who rarely or never has scotch. Little or no burn. No ""peaty"" taste. Super malty, almost like a caramel. If you are buying for a scotch-lover or for someone who loves whiskey and would like to try scotch, you can't go wrong with this label.",5
"Love this sauce. It's fantastic in rice dishes, and as a replacement for soy sauce--much less salty.",5
Hickory Harvest different flavored licorice makes redvine taste like dirt! hickory harvest alllllllllll the way best licorice i ever had i never loved licorice untill i tried the blue raspberry and watermelon flavors,5
"My dog's stool softened up after switching him to this stuff from Canidae All Life Stages. It's one step down from the top tiered stuff, but it's cheaper than the top tiered stuff, too. I found this product by doing some dog food research [...].",5
"I can purchase an 18 pack of these at Target for $11.99 (that's $0.61/cup) instead of the much-too-high $0.85 per cup price here. Beware Amazon Prime members....K cups aren't a good deal on Amazon, despite the free two day shipping.<br />The coffee itself is GREAT. I basically like a cup of mud, as bold as it gets. This is that, with a great burnt taste and wonderful aroma.<br />HIGHLY recommend the coffee, but get it at Target.",3
"Ok these trays are SMALL and better suited for small to medium breed doggies. They are each the size of a dime. They are bait tiny for my large breed doggie but he eats them and likes them, so they seem to please a dogs taste buds. I would not buy them again because they are too small for my dog, but someone with a little dog will most likely love them. They are also low fat so they are great for dogs on diets.",4
"Received chocolate in a box that was dirty and dusty. The chocolate itself had some old dust residue on the pieces of chocolate. I opened the chocolate, and guess what? It had ""white spots"" along the side. (Please see photo uploaded for this item) - Those who are familiar with milk chocolate, when it sits for a long time it develops white spots and loses its flavor. This is exactly what happened to the box of chocolate that they sent me. There was no flavor at all coming from this chocolate. It had an expiration date of ""08/2011"" but it was clear that this chocolate had been sitting around for a very long time. I asked politely for an exchange, and they kept giving me paste + copy responses saying that they did not do any refunds or exchanges and kept referring me to their return policy. I kept going back and forth and they were just not willing to do anything to accommodate my problem with this chocolate. Their customer service on the phone was horrible, the gentleman was not empathetic at all. They even sent an e-mail stating ""This is how Kinder Bueno is supposed to look, are you sure you've tried this candy before?"" SO RUDE!!<br /><br />The main reason I'm writing this, is because I LOVE Kinder Bueno. When I first had this in Germany, I fell in love! It was the perfect mix between Kit Kat and Nutella. However this company has really ruined this treat for me.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE FROM PARTHENON FOODS.",1
Exceptional taste but not quite what we first had at the casino.  We will try other roasts until we find it!!,5
"THE ABOVE ITEMS WERE DELIVERED ON TIME, AND WERE BEYOND EXPECTATION.<br /><br />THE ITEMS WERE FRESH, AND TASTED GOOD, AND WERE ENJOYED BY ALL.  MANY THANKS.",5
These sugar free meringues are not very good.  They are very grainy.  I much prefer the ones with sugar but those were out of stock.,1
"I can't imagine my taste buds being that different than all the other reviewers here but the tea I received tasted terrible.  Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know... what I DO know is that I could have spent $30 on something far more palatable.",1
"I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.  This Nantucket blend was easily the best of the bunch.  It truly is a great tasting coffee and I can't believe it comes out of my Keurig.<br /><br />Now I do drink a cup of coffee every day and I'm not fond of the waste that this product produces so I actually have one of these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> and grind my own coffee.  It's cheaper and better for the environment and it's what I use for myself.  However, the fine dust does pass through the filter so I don't like to give it to guests.  I don't mind the dust though that settles at the bottom of the cup and for being much cheaper I don't mind.<br /><br />These cups though I save for my guests so that they can get a great cup of coffee without any of the dust.  And they all love this coffee.",5
Nantucket is my husband's favorite K-cup coffee. He has a Keurig coffeemaker at work and at home.<br />You can't beat the convenience and taste.,5
"If you're a fan of peanut snacks and peanut bars, don't pass up the Planters Big Nut Bars. There are plenty of peanuts and peanut butter to keep you happy. I liked the triple nut variant of the Planters bars (tested in another review) but found the almonds and cashews to be overpowered by peanuts in a good way. These Double Peanut bars just capitalizes on the peanut taste and makes it even better! The bars are very large but they only come in a box of 5. I wish they'd squeeze in maybe 6-8 bars per box.<br /><br />Pros: Nutty taste, large servings<br /><br />Cons: Only 5 per box.",5
"Bionaturae is my favorite brand of whole-wheat pasta, and I've tried quite a few. It's smooth, as opposed to many brands whose pasta is gritty and rough. The flavor is excellent, as well.",5
"These cookies are fantastic!  They are very rich and tasty.  Each cookie contains rather large chocolate chunks.  As Tony the Tiger would say, ""GREAT""!!!",4
"this is a good product for people who like gum but have dental work to which most gum sticks.<br /><br />I've ordered from Amazon because they have the best price for bulk purchases; I save almost 40% off per-pack retail prices.<br /><br />There is potential for a problem; Wrigley dates each of its bulk packages with a best by date. Generally, Wrigley gum is 'fresh' if the best by date is 6 months or more in the future. Current shipments from Amazon are dated 5/9/09; this is only 2 months away. There is potential to receive stale product; Amazon would most likely accept a return but we don't buy things with the expectation we will return them.",3
"My wife and I settled on the Light Strawberry Banana after trying almost all of the V-Fusion variants.  It is sweet enough to satisfy fruit craving and masks the vegetable tastes, but it's light enough not to leave an aftertaste (and with reduced calories compared to the regular version).  We have been enjoying this product daily for two years without getting tired of it.  Like other V-Fusion products it offers various vitamins and antioxidants.<br /><br />The 8-pack with free shipping was a great deal compared to our local supermarket so I hope Amazon re-stocks it soon!",5
My akita is an extremely finicky dog. He is hard to train with food since none of the treats I buy seem to please him...until I got the Exclusively Dog Best Buddy Bits Peanut Butter Flavor Dog Treats for him. He is now trained and well behaved. He would do anything for these delicious and easy to dissolve treats! These little treats are perfect for training!,5
"I am an avid macaron baker (the French macarons not the American ones.) I've had some problems with the yellow messing up my shell batter.  I feel like the color is not as intense, therefore I have to use more of it to get the desired color.  I'd been using the limited range of powdered colors that I have, and thought that switching over to the gel stuff would be okay but it has been troublesome for me.  Regardless, the colors (save yellow) are bright and vibrant.",3
"The same author wrote ""Where the Wild Things Are.""  Carol King wrote a great song that matches all the lyrics.  The illustrations are fabulous.  I wish I could buy it hardbound and larger.  It is a tiny book and easily misplaced.  My 3 year-old carries it everywhere.",5
"I have been making Chateau Classico kits for about a year now. The initial batches were as directed using included ingredients. The results were drinkable, decent wine. But adding Medium plus toast American Oak chips, really pushed these kits over the top for me. The result of putting this kit (and a Dolcetto) on oak for a week was a fuller bodied, immensely drinkable wine.<br /><br />The kit does not include any kind of oak like some others. I may try adding some oak powder when I pitch the yeast in the next batch to see how the wine changes.<br /><br />So far, I cannot complain about this brand of kit. I subscribe and save $15 per kit, which brings this kit in at almost half the price of some of the better known manufacturer's kits. With a little experimentation, you can get excellent results with this kit.",5
"Too expensive to buy from amazon. With coupon , it is way cheaper to order direct from the manufacturer's site",1
"Great deal, fast shipping.  Saved a lot buying these biscuits through Amazon - These biscuits are four dollars more a box at Pets Smart and other pet stores.",5
"This mix is good quality but is very heavy on cashews, very light on pecans, and probably has too many Brazil nuts (which are high in selenium) to be safe for some people, especially if they're taking selenium supplements.",4
"My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all.",1
"My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again. There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China.",1
"My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.",1
"I got a free sample chocolate chip cookie from the company's website as I wasn't sure about ordering a package without trying one first, but I shouldn't have worried.  These cookies are amazing!  Really, they will leave you saying Wow!  They are thick, moist, and chewy, which is not easy to find in a gluten free cookie.  They're also very generously sized, so one is more than enough to satisfy a sweet craving.  I think they're probably better than most ""regular"" cookies I've had!  I'll definitely be ordering some!",5
"I bought these at the grocery store because I was looking for something more natural and low fat for my dogs. They absolutely LOVED them! They get them first thing in the morning after going outside and when its time to come inside they cant get inside the house fast enough and run up the stairs to where I keep the box! I have 2 chihuahuas and a cocker. I break the larger ones in half for the chihuahuas most of the time. I found out I could buy them online through Amazon and save money buying 6 at a time, cheaper than I can buy them at the grocery!  Thank you for this great item!",5

"This was the first time that I had tried any Marley Coffee but I really like it. It is certainly a high quality coffee and has an excellent flavor. I am a little picky about my coffee and usually stick to Starbucks Sumatra or Caff&eacute; Verona because I enjoy bolder and more flavorful coffee. Marley Coffee One Love blend is every bit as good as my favorite coffee and I really enjoy it. There are 15 single serve pods in this package and each pod is packed with plenty of coffee so it makes a great tasting cup of coffee. The pods and individually wrapped in foil so they stay very fresh and it makes them easy to store and carry with you.<br /><br />These pods are for a pod brewer not to be mistaken for a Keurig, Tassimo, CBTL or any other type of single serve coffee maker. I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way.",5
I used this for the first time as a night cream since my skin was dry from the weather here in Los Angeles. I woke up and noticed my face looking refreshed and hydrated without any of the breakouts that other products leave behind. It's like it actually went beyond the surface of my skin!,5
I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected. Also it smells and taste better than I expected!,4
I love this tea. It is delicious. It came in a timely manner and I was very pleased.,5
"Bone looked great, length was great, BUT my Mastiff managed to chew joint ends off and then started getting shards of bone.  Had to remove it and throw it away.",2
"Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.",1
Great alternative to the real thing. Will be buying again real soon. Recommended to my family and friends. Great find.,5
"I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!",5
"I've been using this seasoning for years and it makes food taste great.  Good for vegetables, for soups, anything that you'd use season salt on.  My kids love it!",5
I really enjoyed this coffee. I am new to the whole K-Cup thing and these were really good. I will definitely purchase this product again. Great tasting coffee.,5
I tried these mints and found the aroma to be wonderful. The taste however leaves something to be desired. I found it too much like eating something dunked in perfume. The aftertaste was also a bit unpleasant. Not something I will purchase again.,1
"I have purchased this for approximately the past year and it has truly helped out 19 year old Maltese!  I was to the point a year ago having to give him Metacam (Pain medicine) everyday.  I have literally only used it for a few times in the past 8 months!  I now also have my son buying it for his pomeranian, who also has bad back legs.  KEEP selling this product I will buy it constantly!!!!!!",5
Product was a Christmas gift.  Order for Land O Lakes cocoa mix quickly filled and delivered.  No problems.  Have used Amazon service before and always go to Amazon first.,5
"Even though the dates on the boxes were a year away, and the shipment arrived in two days because of my Amazon Prime, the crackers were still stale in the worst way imaginable.  Contacted Amazon via chat and got a refund.  Ew.",1
"Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.",5
"After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried. We took the effort to slowly introduce the food and gave it a good 4 months before finally giving up.<br /><br />Our dogs did not seem to really like this food. I am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them. It would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it.<br /><br />After much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food, even if it might extend their life a little.<br /><br />We settled on Science Diet brand. They gobble it up at every meal and have returned to normal bowel movements. I realize the ingredients are not as good as Wellness brand, but I feel better about their quality of life.",2
The size of this container is amazing. It is everything it says it to be. Organic is the way to go. free shipping :),5
"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak.",2
"Excellent ""fig-newton"" option for gluten free.  Authentic ingredients and not too sweet.  Really enjoy them!  However, you can buy them much cheaper on the jovial website.",4
"I think these are good. I've losing weight so I eat a couple of these ( plain/w coffee ) for breakfast to keep the weight loss effect going. I find myself thinking about eating them at other times, but I normally don't. A glass of water and 2 of these will work wonders if you can't resist the urge to eat something. These are good plain or you can put something on them. I've got quite a few broken ones because of the shipping, but not a problem for me.",5
I have a 105 lb. male yellow lab who can tear through most chew toys in mere hours. This Nylabone is his favorite by far. We are on our third one and counting. Each one lasts about 6 months. Eventually he will work off one of the ends and start ripping chunks off the green rubber center part. That's when I know it's time to pry it out of his jaws and order another one :),5
"A friend of mine suggested these noodles as a good alternative to pasta.  I have to say, very pleased.  I just added sauted veggies to it with a soy sauce with baked marinated chicken and the family loved it.  These are a winner and will be trying the other versions as well.  It's worth the extra money (being that pasta is cheap in the store) for cutting out the bad stuff!",5
Taste great cold! Not so good room tempErature. It's cheaper by the case especially since it's hard to find in stores.,4
"I wanted these candies to go with a provence theme dinner. I remembered them from a trip to France long ago. The candies are just as I remembered, delicious. They are delicate and not too sweet with a nutty, slightly floral citrus taste, very subtle. Everyone at the dinner liked them. (Good thing since they are sort of expensive.)<br /><br />However, I was disappointed in the packaging. They used to come in a charming tin. Now the container is thin plastic. I should have guessed. But that destroyed some of the elegance of the presentation.",4
Unlike the regular chocolate bar this one is 50% air. Hershey isn't cutting the price either. Just a way for nestle to cut the costs. Baloney!,1
I was very pleased with the service and speed of delivery as well as the overall freshness of the product. I will definitely order again!,5
"Best Feline Friend cat food cost more for less food. I did not try it but my cat eats few bites and look at me for something else. I found that it has a very strong smell of fish compared to other brand. In other word may be the food is too concentrated.Despite the much higher cost I would have given my cat this brand if he would have liked it.Sorry ""Best Feline"" but I did not decide. If you want more details ask Wicket, my cat.",3
IT WAS BETTER THIS TIME THE LAST TIME I ORDERED THIS I WAS MISSING 3 SLIM JIM OUT OF THE BOX.  I SAW THE BOX OPEN WHEN I RECIEVED IT.  SO I SAT THERE AND COUNTED AND I WAS MISSING 3 SLIM JIM.  I TRIED TO RIGHT A REVIEW BUT THERE WASN'T AN OPTION FOR ME TO DO SO.  I WS DISAPPOITNED LAST TIME.  THIS TIME THE BOX CAME CLOSED AND WHEN I COUNTED I COUNTED EXACTLY 100.,3
"......for whatever reason, these are just too mushy.  I've gotten them from Amazon twice now and both times they've been like this.  They should be a little more aged or firm or whatever you want to call it.  It's hard to snap into a Slim Jim when it's mush.  I think I'll just stick to buying them in a store.",3
"There is a light carmel/molassis flavor but it's not too strong for me.  We enjoy it in tea, fruit smoothies, on hot breakfast cereals and everything we'd use sugar for.  I found the best deal price wise at Country Life Natural Foods.  It's good stuff!  I also use pure stevia powder in food items so I need less sugar.  It's sweet and natural with no calories.",5
"I wanted to love these bags, but the truth is that I put more of them in the garbage than I used for garbage because simply pulling them apart at the perforations caused tears to start, and once the tears started they just kept getting longer and longer as I every so gently tried to open the bag in a way that would salvage it. I'll look for other compostable garbage bags. These ones need some work!",1
"The other bags I was using (perf go green),  I found out,  were not actuallly plastic free I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to green products so I felt tricked to say the least.  These are made of cornstarch so they are the ones to use if you wanna be really green.  I don't put alot of garbage in them so I can't say they would stand up to that,  and I think they could use handles since they are hard to tie,  a little thin as well, but worth it to avoid the plastic.  The price is great compared to stores hardly anyone carries these and if they do they are about 6.00 per box",4
Hands down one of my favorite Stash teas. A dash of sugar in a cup of this and I'm in heaven. Great to drink in the morning or afternoon.,5
"If this had the same amount of calories as ice cream, or even frozen yogurt, I would be giving the product 1 star. However, part of the appeal of Arctic Zero is that it is so low in calories. It is important to note that this is not ice cream nor does it taste like ice cream. I found that when I ate it straight out of the carton, it had a slightly weird aftertaste.<br />My advice to anyone who orders Arctic Zero is that you should go into it with the idea that you're going to get a frozen protein shake rather than the idea that you're going to get an amazing ice cream for only 64 calories for a cup. That would be too good to be true.<br />While I wouldn't eat Arctic Zero (at least not the chocolate peanut butter, which is the only flavor that I've tried) plain, I found that it does make for a good base for shakes (although, I would probably not purchase this product again). When I mixed it with a few other ingredients like milk, ice, fruit, cocoa powder, better 'n peanut butter, etc. I found that the strange aftertaste disappeared and I was left with a distinct chocolate flavor with a hint of peanut in the background.<br />Again, I will warn you, do not spend the money for this product if you're hoping to find a low calorie ice cream substitute. As I stated above, that's not what you're going to get!<br /><br />Edited to add: I have to add one thing that I'm hoping that I'm wrong about. I'm wondering if the company is writing some product reviews to encourage (or mislead) others to buy their product. I certainly don't want to point the finger at anyone. However, I find it hard to believe that there are so many reviews that state that the product tastes like a rich and decadent desert. I find it hard to believe that anyone would claim that this product is mind-blowingly good or that it could be compared to regular ice cream, unless they had something to gain by doing so. Read the reviews for yourself and pay attention to the dates in which they were written as well as the fact that the good reviews seem to be rated as helpful, whereas the bad reviews are frequently either rated as unhelpful or are commented on by someone who seems to be invested in Arctic Zero. Perhaps I am wrong, as I have no real evidence to support my assumption. However, something doesn't seem quite right, and that needs to be addressed considering how pricey the product is.",3
"I had a small bag of Chicken Poppers that I took on a trip with us.  Dogs can get pretty finacky in a strange environment but the chicken poppers really settled her down.  And they had such a satisfying crunch when she ate them!  I had no idea where to get more, but then I found them on Amazon!  THanks for a great product!",5
"While these will never be mistaken for fast-food french fries, they are quite yummy and oh-so-much healthier! The name really says it all: Lesser Evil. My husband liked them too, and he hasn't been eating exclusively diet food lately like I have. There is a bit of a...somewhat ""powdered"" aspect (that's pretty much what they are) and there's definitely a residue on your teeth after eating them, but I'm glad I bought them and will enjoy them as an occasional treat.",5
"This is a GREAT product!  Steaks are delicious with this rub.  I put it on about 4 hours before grilling.  The spices are delicious and penetrate the meat.  I highly recommend this product.  Because I couldn't find it in any stores near me, I ordered it on-line and found the company very responsive. Should be five stars.",5
"I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a ""hot spot"" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an ""allergic reaction.""  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.",1
"I ordered these noodles in bulk after trying them out first. I really like the taste of them especially when I add spaghetti sauce. I would not recommend ordering in bulk, unless you plan to eat them all in a month. My entire box had an expiration date approximately two months after I purchased them. I ended up sharing them with friends so that I didn't have to throw them out, when my intention was to have it for months of meals. I rated them on the low end only because of the early expiration date.",2
"I am not gluten intolerant but my 2 grandsons are. My daughter-in-law bought the Glutino gluten free pretzel twists for the kids and when I tasted them, I was hooked!!! They are, hands down, the BEST PRETZELS I've ever had. A nice crispy texture, not hard, with a great flavor. Much better than any regular wheat flour pretzels you can buy. Try them... if you dare... LOL, but be forewarned, you'll be hooked too!!!",5
"The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...",3
"I wish I'd known the ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips when I bought these (the ingredient list was not part of the product description as the time of this review).  There's no real cinnamon in them.  I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips.  They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips.<br /><br />Well, curiosity killed the cat.  Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods.....  I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it.  I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW.  Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of  artificial color!  I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing.  Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips.  Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give.<br /><br />Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star?  My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.<br /><br />Ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips:<br />Sugar; nonfat milk; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel and soybean oil); palm kernel oil; contains 2% or less of: cornstarch; artificial colors (Yellow 6 Lake; Yellow 5 Lake; Blue 2 Lake); natural and artificial flavor; salt; palm oil; soy lecithin.",3
"As a weight loss coach, I often talk about quinoa.  The Aztecs called this ""the food of the Gods"" and it truly is...incredibly healthy and full of vitamins, protein, antioxidants and it's extremely filling. I have gotten many people hooked on it using it as a substitute for rice.  I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.<br /><br />But having ""good"" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.<br /><br />It does here.  These are addictive.  I typically buy them at Target or Central Market but it's cheaper to get them here with subscribe and save and no taxLove these...and I actually feel GOOD about putting them in my body. A rarity for a snack.  Bring on the cheddar and I'll sign up for auto delivery.  Try em with hummus.<br /><br />Alternatives: I am also equally addicted to barbecue PoPChips...they are also an all natural snack that's low in fat and calories but highly addictive in my opinion.",5
"I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM"">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.",3
"My husband and I love, love, love Sans Sucre products!  We can't tell that it's sweetened with Splenda, but younger members of our family can.  I hope that's not a factor for you.  This is the first low fat yummy treat that doesn't make up for it with tons of sodium.  My husband is a diabetic who has had multiple-bypass surgery.  We were told to look for lower fat, lower sodium foods.  The hospital dietician was very pleased with the ingredients and all the Nutrition Facts info.  We gave her a couple of empty boxes to use in her nutrition classes.  We've recommended it to other folks, and they've all loved it.",5
This tea is the BEST for alleviating cold symptoms and soothing a sore throat. I ordered this case for my sister and have previously given boxes of this tea to various friends and coworkers. Everybody raves about it!,5
I needed to view the product and see what was included in the gift basket so presentation of the items was great and informative.  The recipients were extremely pleased with the gift and thoroughly enjoyed the various tasty treats.  Thank you for this thoughtful Christmas Holiday Sleigh Gourmet Food Gift Basket.,5
"My daughter loves these snacks!  I love them because they are so easy to take on little trips, and they don't mash into her clothes like other snacks.  (They do leave crumbs, but are easy to wipe off.)  Amazon has a much better deal on these than what I can find in the stores, plus free shipping with prime!",5
"When we searched for Garretts popcorn, it came up but what Amazon attempted to send me is not Garrett's Popcorn, but some Popcornolopis brand that I have no idea of.  I could spend 70 bucks at a local popcorn shop if I wanted popcorn other than Garrett's.  I don't understand the advertising it as Garretts,,,,wonder if Garrett's knows this?  Ummmmm",1
"I really like the flavor of this tea. It's very mild with a pleasant hint of spice and fruit. I used 3 bags a day for a mild effect. It didn't force me to go, it just made it easier. It's definitely much better than traditional laxitives.",5
"Marinade a pork tenderlion, grill, then use the meat to make Cuban Sandwiches. YUM.<br />You can search the internet for the basic Cuban Sandwich recipe, but definitely use Mojo Criollo for the pork marinade. I've tried other homemade recipes for the marinade - this tastes better, is easier and economical.<br />One of our favorites.",5
"Ingredient list speaks for itself.<br /><br />You pay for what you get...do your cat a favour, spend a bit more on him/her. They need a lot more than useless cereal filler. Just because it gets eaten doesn't mean it's good for them does it....",1
"I cooked up some of these for myself last night while the rest of my family had regular semolina linguine. I was afraid I was going to feel pretty deprived, but when I spooned some alfredo sauce on my little Tinkyada GF pasta shells and took a bite--they were GOOD! I found myself wishing I had cooked a few more for seconds.<br /><br />The texture and flavor are great. The only flaw I could see, a very minor one, is that if I had cooked these the full 14-16 minutes suggested they probably would have been quite mushy. I didn't time it exactly, but I think I probably cooked mine about half that time.<br /><br />I will be buying more Tinkyada products.",5
"""Eclipse Breeze Exotic Berry"" gum is surprisingly unpleasant tasting as the cardamom and berry flavors do not go together! I bought this flavor after trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9ZX8C"">Eclipse breeze exotic mint sugar free chewing gum - 12/pack, 12 ea</a> (which is very good ""*****"") and was very disappointed. Just to be sure that it wasn't only me, my kids tried it as well and they both found it to be ""gross"".<br /><br />The only real upside of this sugarfree gum is that after the berry flavor goes away, the cardamom does do a good job freshening your breath.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",2
"I purchased this based on the ""natural"" ingredients and a general thumbs-up from my vet. My first dog got very sick with severe vomiting. Thinking she got into something unrelated to the food, I continued to feed this to my other dog. Within 2 days my other dog got sick as well. The result = 2 sick dogs + a vet bill. The remaining cans went in the trash immediately.  I would NEVER recommend this dog food to anyone.",1
"Been feeding my pups this for years and love it. They have never had problems with it and have put on some weight(they are lazy half the time,lol) I would recommend it to anyone with animals.",5
This is the first decaf coffee I have ever liked. I can honestly say you can not taste the difference between this and regular coffee. I will order this again and again.  :),5
"I bought this tea last month for $9.20 - six boxes. After reading the reviews, I had to try it. It is a little bit better than Lipton, but not as good as Tazo. I would not buy this again.",2
"My oldest child is milk allergic and we have switched to Silk for him . . . but travelling has always been a major issue.  I found the individual aseptic packs at a big box store, but they're popular and always out of stock!!!  Now they come to my door, perfect for travel and playdates and when mommy forgot to buy more at the store!  SO happy!",5
"We liked this product, used it on salads and on eggs, a little goes a long way.",5
"I would love it if I could buy Bob's of Red Mill Products.  Unfortunately, they process their items on non-dedicated equipment and our family is tree nut and peanut allergic as well as gluten free.  The sad thing is that this company is slowly moving the competition off the grocery store shelves and making it more and more expensive to find safe alternatives.  We buy from Gluten Free Oats® that was founded by a family who has three generations of people with celiac disease and they only do one product so no need to worry about nut contamination.  For flours, we have to buy everything online from lots of different companies now as Arrowhead Mills is all but eliminated from our healthfood store shelves.  If it wasn't for Amazon.com I don't know how I would do all this shopping. Thanks, AMAZON.COM!",1
"I have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew (50% Pomeranian, 50% Australian Shepard). I sure caught the name ""everlasting"" in this product. I got her one and gave it to her the other day. She ripped it open and ate the treat (which is big) in 12 min, and then started to rip the rubber/plastic. This thing is garbage, any dog will rip right through it. Not only is it not ""everlasting"", it was about the worst lasting chew she has ever had. My advice is do not buy this product, your dog will eat right through it and end up ingesting plastic.",1
"These have a fairly good flavor and the texture is ok. They definitely are not thin like a chip, more like a frito. A little high on price, but still okay for a snack.",3
"The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps.",3
"This coffee isn't worth the extra money.  It's no better than any low cost Keurig Cups.  They're hammering you on the ""Starbucks"" name, but the coffee tastes nothing special.  Certainly NOT like regular Starbucks coffee.",2
"Absolutely my favorite bread! Bake it weekly. Cannot find this product in my local grocery stores. Since I starting using this mix, have not purchased a single loaf of store bought bread. Nothing better than freshly baked bread and this mix is so simple to use and a money saver in the hot summers of Texas with no oven heat running up the AC bill while baking this in the bread machine.",5
"We bought this bread with high hopes since we had been making bread for a while now. However, this bread won't rise. I replaced the yeast thinking that it was bad and I have used different temperatures of water, and still nothing. We live in VA altitude is not an issue. Your product is.",1
"Mum-mums are one of my favorite finds for baby. We have given them to our three children as early as 6 months.<br />We LOVE them!!! They disolve almost instantly, so there's not much worry of choking; they have a nice crisp so they feel good on teething gums; they are not very messy like most teething crackers; the ingredient list is simple - not loaded with sugar or preservatives; and most importantly they love them!<br />They are also conveniently wrapped in two packs, so they are great to throw in your purse or diaper bag.<br />My 3 and 5 year olds still ask for them when I have them out for my 11 month old.<br />Also love that they come in organic as well as a vegetable flavor now.<br />I buy them buy the case!!!",5
"Okay, first, you need to know that I usually don't buy cookies, we try to really limit our sweets intake and we also try to eat things that are 100% whole grain, so cookies just don't fit into that, we also shop almost exclusively in the natural/organic section.  I love regular Fig Newtons, but stopped eating them when we started eating whole grain and no/low sugar.  Also please know, I do not like crunchy cookies, I like soft cookies.  That said, I was surprised by how much I liked these.  They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the orange and oat more than the cranberry, but over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.  The first ingredient is enriched flour, but they do have some whole wheat flour and whole oats in them too, the are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and has fructose listed near the end.  We won't buy treats or sweetened cereal where a serving has more than 9 grams of sugar, and guess what?  These only have 7 grams of sugar per serving which is three cookies.  I will not at all feel bad letting my kids eat these cookies, especially since a serving for a preschooler would be one cookie.  I only wish there was more fiber (more whole grain) in these.  I also like that they bag is re-sealable.",4
"I was not all that impressed with the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These are probably not a product I would buy in large quantities for my family,<br /><br />I liked that this is a soft cookie and there is a center full of chocolate.<br /><br />I did not like that the chocolate seemed to have a funny artificial aftertaste and that the cookies fell apart easily.  There are lots of cookie crumbs left in the package and I resorted to having people eat them outside because they fall apart and make such a mess.",3
"The Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are incredibly rich and chocolaty.  They remind me of Subway's double chocolate chip cookies, which are my favorites - except these go an extra step and have a gooey chocolate center. The centers aren't as creamy as the packaging or commercial would lead you to believe. But these are now one of my top picks for cookies. Delicious. Decadent. These will satisfy the most demanding of sweet tooth's.",5
"I have eaten Chips AHoy! cookies since I was a kid. There is nothing better than the Chips AHoy cookies and a glass of milk. Although their cookies are a little crunchy, with milk they're absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Their new cookies are even better. These are a soft chewy chocolate cookie with a gooey center that's also made of chocolate. You can get these either in fudge or dark chocolate.<br /><br />I tried the fudge, and I like these better than the original cookies now. In fact, if you're looking for a sweet snack that is satisfying, 2 of these cookies and an 8 oz glass of milk are perfect.<br /><br />These cookies are really sweet, and the chocolate center of the cookie is really melt in your mouth. That was the part I liked best: the chocolate middle. It just feels so good on your tongue, and it tastes even better, really smooth.<br /><br />If you're a chocolate lover who is looking for a sweet treat that will quickly satisfy you, this is it.",5
These are my daughter's favorite snacks - and these folks offer them in an affordable way - they were shipped quickly and she loves them!  THANKS!,5
"This salt was a gift, I opened and it smells so bad, I think I need to place in garage or add 1 letter ""b"" and it might work out better for my family.. (GARBAGE) Smells like a nursing home.. Bad Jar?? Who knows.. Dont know what to say..<br />The packaging was nice, just dont crack the seal... Sorry, being honest...",1
"I was looking for ""sticky rice"" and couldn't find it locally, so I turned to Amazon. This is good short grain / sticky / calrose rice (depending on what you call it). The bigger bags from other sellers are a better value, but I have gotten this one a few times as it is easier to store.",4
"This is not the same product as the Brach's product found in retail stores.  These have a different coating with a peanut inside.  It seems that this is ""Brachs Maple Nut Goodies"" and the real candy is ""Brach's Maple Nut Goodies"".  Kind of deceiving isn't it?  A total rip-off!",1
"I've been using EZ-Sweetz for a couple years now, and am totally sold on it. I wish I could buy it locally instead of the manufacturer or Amazon (no offense, EZ or Amazon!) just for convenience. I started out with the more concentrated version, then switched over to this 1 drop = 1 tsp container. I reload the smaller sized bottles to keep in my purse and desk at work, and also to cut my losses if I lose a bottle, as I did recently.<br /><br />So just to confirm I'm totally sold on EZ-Sweetz and will continue to purchase it, I want to say that dispensing from this bottle can be quite variable from one purchase to the next. Sometimes it's really quite a chore to squeeze a drop or two out, and the next bottle squirts it out too easily, practically in a stream. I'm careful when using a new bottle because I hate to waste it and the drink I'm trying to sweeten. (Learned the hard way!) There have also been a couple of bottles that seemed to be a weaker concentration than the previous one or the one after. I drink a lot of tea, and it's easy to tell when 3 drops isn't enough today, when it was fine yesterday. It's a little frustrating, but like I said, I'm a big fan regardless.<br /><br />5 stars for the product, 4 for the packaging and product variability!",4
The powder was contaminated with so much sand that it was unusable and had to be trashed.,1
"I'm not crazy about mint teas in general, but this one does have an interesting flavor. Unfortunately I had the same experience as another reviewer, and the tea tastes old. The sell by date says it doesn't expire until like 2014, but I wonder if maybe they repackaged old stuff? (It only gives a date on the outside box containing the 6 boxes of teas.) I bought several other teas from the Amazon that were fine, just this one.<br /><br />That being said, this is a great tea for people that drink a lot of tea and want a change of pace once and awhile. Just get it somewhere else than Amazon!",3
"As a previous reviewer stated - I used to buy this product and it was very good - very spicy.  I have purchased several jars over the last several months, at different locations, and this product no longer is any good - at all.  The jar I just opened was supposed to be good until 2011 - it was totally bland, and looked old.  I don't know what Thai Kitchen is doing - but - their curry pastes are bland.  It seems like the curry is very old.  Or, the jars are not sealed properly.  I have even sent emails to Thai Kitchen about this.  This vendor has a problem.  Go to an Asian market and get a real curry paste.  It makes a WORLD of difference.  (I'm sorry Thai Kitchen - but you need to get it together !!)",1
"Be aware that Kraft changed the recipe for this ""new"" mac and cheese! What used to be called the ""Old World Italian"" flavor, which came with a bread crumb topping, has been replaced with a creamy alfredo cheese sauce (with no crumb topping option). The picture which appears above is the older version; however, if you purchase this item, you will receive the new, updated ""formula"". I made the mistake of purchasing this thinking it was the old kind and it wasn't. (As a side note, you can't typically return grocery items!)",2
Our dog now reminds us to give him is pill - that was always a hassle to give to him before.  Now he is attentive in the morning waiting for pill time.  I like this better then using lunchmeat or peanut butter because we keep the pills in a pill case and we can put the pill in the pill pocket and put the whole thing in the M-F pill case.,5
"Easiest mix ever!!! Just like I remember the regular wheat filled mixes being, in 5 minutes or so the brownies are ready to go into the oven. And the results are delicious! These brownies were chewy and thick and really, really good.",5
This quickly became my favorite coffee I make every morning.  Strong enough to make on larger setting without losing it's coffee goodness.  I make it on smaller setting sometimes when I want even stronger. There is never a bitter after taste.  The only negative thing I can say is I can't use my carosel to store these pods. I keep in a Ziplock type bag that keeps them quite fresh.,5
"I really like this coffee. It's bold, yet smooth as well. I especially appreciate the simpler packaging with much less plastic waste. Additionally, I don't think the coffee grounds touch plastic at all, just the foil top and filter. They work impeccably in my Keurig.",5
"Normally I love granola but....<br />I tried this straight out of the bag, sprinkled on yogurt and in a bowl of milk and in every variation it just tasted stale to me. I don't know if that's the flavor from the flax seed or what but it was not appealing. I also pawned some off on my kids to try and they didn't care for it either. I would have to say it is better with something than alone (both to mask it's taste and because it is very crumbly)<br /><br />On the plus side it seems very healthy... perhaps by the time I finish the bag I will have acquired a taste for it.",3
"Out of all of the different bones and treats we've given our dog, these are one of his all time favorites!",5
"this is my new favorite brand of raw pecans, nothing added just the way i like them. These are dated well ahead into 2012 and I love the taste, WOW QUALITY!!! Wish they would make larger packages, I would like double the amount. thank you for keeping this avail.",5
"My 85-lb lab destroys anything he decides to chew, including the biggest, toughest rawhide, smoked bones, rubber tires, even granite kitchen countertops...that is until he got these moose antlers.  He stays occupied for hours.  He has been chewing consistently on two antlers for over nine months now.  Needless to say, these are WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!  (As a comparison he just mowed through $10 worth of tennis balls in less than a weekend).<br /><br />Definitely will buy again and highly recommend!!",5
"Don,t buy, unless you like strong after tastes, and way to spicy.This is not mongo syrup ,like the way it might be, with some<br />sot spices added in.",1
"I have been waiting for a packaged soft cookie that can recreate the melted yumminess of<br />chocolate chips in a fresh baked cookie. Nabisco has mastered the art of creating melted chips<br />with each bite, but that is as far as it goes.<br /><br />The overall goodness of this cookie is lacking- it tastes like a packaged cookie. Its softness<br />fools you into thinking fresh baked, yet when you take a bite, you are quickly reminded of the<br />preservatives that must be contained in each cookie.<br /><br />The cookie is not at all the size represented on the packaging. It is considerably smaller. Once<br />you pick one up to eat, it crumbles into several pieces. Basically, it falls apart before you can<br />even take a bite.<br /><br />The packaging does contain a freshness seal so that after you open the pack, you will be able to<br />reseal to ensure freshness.<br /><br />This cookie is getting two stars simply because I love the concept of melted chips in a packaged<br />cookie but I think the title ""Chewy"" is a bit of a stretch. The more appropriate title would be<br />CCCC-Crumbly Chocolate Chip Cookies!",2
"Dog loves it and despite sensitive stomach, does very well on it. Good price. Love having it arrive right at my door...and my cats like it too :)",5
"Since my cat was diagnosed with allergy to chicken, I have found this particular product its favorite. I have tried numerous sources, both local and online, to find a steady supply. Only Amazon.com has been able to fulfill this need regularly.",5
"I bought this tea as a gift based on the fact that all the other stash teas I've personally tried have been good, and several months later after the initial disappointment we are still trying to make it come together right. The problem with this one is that the chocolate does not blend right with the actual tea. The flavors are all there, but the chocolate unfortunately feels filmy and leaves a weird lingering taste. The package suggests adding milk and sugar to bring out the hazelnut. This works for that purpose but the chocolate still does not come out right in either flavor or texture. Also, mixing the tea with hot chocolate overpowers the hazelnut. It helps to steep the tea bag in pure hot milk with no water added, though.",2
What a lovely tea with just the right hint of mango flavor.  Great hot or iced.  I'm hooked for life!,5
"Awesome product! I have always enjoyed a salty snack from time to time, and corn nuts have the perfect crunch and just the right amount of salt to satisfy!",5
"This is an outstanding product.  The taste is unbelievable for a instant coffee.  If you match this with the Creme Brulee flavored creamer from Coffee Mate, it is fantastic.  You don't need at add anything else.  Right amount of sweetness and complexity as the (artificial) flavors intertwine in a sweet harmonic dance of awesomeness.  You can also drink this black and enjoy the nutty flavor.  None of the aftertaste or characteristics that accompany an instant coffee.  The vanilla and regular Tasters Choice is not even close to this one.  They got it right with this product.  If you enjoy coffee, you will love this product.<br /><br />The best is when you take your cup and jump in a cold car the sweet smell fills your car.  Step out of the car for a second and jump in again, it will be worth it.  Unbelievable.  Try it.  works good in a small car anyway.<br /><br />Such a great product thus it saddens me not to give it the full five star rating.  Just because of the packaging.<br /><br />This is great coffee that needs to be back in the canister.  Please take a moment to send a comment to Nescafe Tasters Choice website under the 'contact us' section.  Its more expensive in the packets under the guise of 'convenience' or 'freshness'.  Lies.  Don't be fooled people.<br /><br />Read a comments under the canisters of this coffee and you will see more.",3
I run 2 of the larger cups of water through my k-cups so I need a fairly sturdy coffee. This one has plenty of flavor and holds up well without being ashy or bitter.,5
"This coffee is good, but it's not as strong as I would like it. It does have a nice flavor although I have to put the coffee maker on a smaller cup size or it's too weak. Still looking for that great cup of coffee.",4
"I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I ""overcooked"" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order. I'll just make 2 at a time. In this case, I received 4 free, so it's hard to really complain all that much.",3
I bought these for my sister who has pancreatic cancer. The Chemo is making her very nauseated and as I know ginger is great for that I thought these would benefit her.  The problem was the were so strong they burned her mouth.  They did the same thing to me.  I know these are great for some people just not for my sister.,2
Well on its own.. it doesn't taste BAD.. but wasn't flavorful on its own. I can see where it would work with a spinach dip or something like that. Doesn't taste bad.. just not enough to make me want to keep eating them or buy more.,2
Why buy artificial products when maple syrup is so much better for us? Price has come down tremendously and it's easier to buy it. My grandchildren love it.,5
"I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.",2
I have been taking this for several days on the advice of my acupuncturist and it has not had any effect on my chronic muscle pain and also has caused me to have loose bowls when going number 2 in the bathroom.<br /><br />does anybody know of a product that can help get lactic acid build up out of muscles?,2
"I love panko! I always use it for chicken katsu or pork katsu.  Typically I coat the meat with rice flour, followed by a mixture of eggs, garlic powder & onion powder. Then I coat the meat in panko before placing it in a pan with heated peanut oil. I wait for it to turn golden brown on one side, then flip. Once it looks done I place it on a plate with paper towels, check that the meat is done and then pat the top of the meat with a paper towel to soak up oil. Using tongs to flip the meat is best, though if you flip it too much the coating might come off. The panko provides just the right crunch (and if you have katsu sauce, all the better!).",5
"If you have ever wished that your honey roasted peanuts would be consistent with a sweet taste, look no further, Emerald has mastered the process.  Don't bother with the rest all they have is a weak substitute.  Don't be fooled these carry the extra calories for a reason, they are coated with honey on every piece from the start to the finish.",5
Great cookies.  These are very crunchy.  Not at all soft.  Very nice taste.<br />Would recommend.,5
"Cooking gluten free, dairy and egg free but also low glycemic for two type-1 diabetics is a real challenge.  This mix works without raising the blood sugar like rice flour mixes.  It also works in the waffle maker with flax gel egg substitue.  It took a year of searching to find it but we love it.  It also handles add-ins like cinnamon or chocolate chips or grated apples.  If you are only used to the white rice flour mixes, it might take some adjustment.  A little extra cooking time behond when my waffle maker says its done makes it crispier.",5
"Our son was having lots of problems with gas (we are breastfeeding and supplimenting) so we tried this formula.  It reduced the amount of gas he had (I was counting the crying mad sessions) -- or at least the amount that he would complain about.  It didn't eliminate it completely, although I really can't tell how much of that might be due to my wife's diet.<br /><br />Regardless, if you have a gassy baby, you may want to give this a try.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to dissolve as well as the 'regular' Enfamil, so you may want to use a knife or something to mash out any balls of Enfamil powder that form.  After doing that, it doesn't have any problems finishing dissolving.",4
"I have two cats who are snack-motivated (the third is not, so her vote is not included), and we tried both the Salmon and the Chicken Crunch n Clean. It's a bit on the pricey side, but as anyone who has ever tried to brush their cat's teeth will tell you, anything that can lend a hand in kitty dental hygiene can be worth it. The cats didn't seem to have a preference between Chicken and Salmon, both chased and gobbled the treats immediately. There's the problem, though: whether it's the size or texture of the treats, or just down to the individual cat, only one of the two cats (same size, generally same disposition) bothered to chew. The other just swallowed it whole. I don't mind giving the cats treats, but prefer other brands for their ""junk food"". In this case, only one of them was getting the possibility of a dental benefit.",3
"As soon as I opened the package, both of my cats were practically sticking their little heads in the bag so they could have some of these treats.  They each ate the 4 or 5 that I gave them right away, so I can tell they really liked them.  One of my cats is very finicky and hesitates to try anything but her regular food, but she loved these.  I can't vouch for the tarter removing benefits because I'm sure it will take time to see, but I'm all for products that have some health benefits along with great taste.  There are vitamins and minerals in the treats too and so I'll feel good about giving them to my cats every day.",5
"Tea is great, but it the description is FALSE and you will receive only one box of 16 tea bags, NOT ""6 Packs"" as advertised.  I wish I had read the reviews first, as I too was expecting 6 boxes.  There are other sellers with 6 boxes that are available with free shipping with my Prime membership.  It appears that Amazon doesn't even read the reviews or they would have fixed this description. I will order this product again, but probably from a different seller with truth in advertising.",2
"When I saw this particular bag of coffee pop up so highly in the search results, and saw the high reviews, I hesitated a moment due to its high price.  But then I decided to go for it, since I'm always up for trying a new coffee, regardless of price, if it's really something spectacular.<br /><br />I received the coffee promptly, and loaded the beans into my high-end burr grinder.  I then brewed the grounds in a french press.  I expected something pretty amazing, or at least an above-average coffee.  Unfortunately, I found neither in this bag.<br /><br />Though I hate to say it, I'd put this coffee on par with Folgers, or some other budget American brand.  It completely lacks flavor...  It's very mild across the whole spectrum, and even lacks body/mouthfeel.  Simply put, it tastes about like cheap diner coffee that's been sitting on a burner for a while.  Really, really disappointing.<br /><br />The only reason I can come up with for the high price is that the quantity is quite high; the bag is enormous (2.2 pounds).  Unfortunately, the quality is exponentially lower.  It's a shame, too; given that British Columbia is so close to Seattle (a place that prides itself on excellent coffee), I expected this to be a great one.  Unless you really need a (giant) cool looking coffee bag design, I'd avoid this one.",2
this is the BEST pumpkin coffee out there. Drank all I could hold during the fall and HAD TO HAVE MORE!!!,5
I actually bought a couple of 2-packs from a local retailer. But I was very disappointed to find out that the 2 cookies are small. Too small in my opinion. If your looking for a decent 2-pack check out Pamela's instead. As far as taste is concerned I was not impressed. The small size could have been tolerated if the flavor was better.,2
"I've been using this Manuka Honey for my ulcers and have noticed such an improvement.  I take some in the morning and usually once more in the afternoon.  I've also used it on canker sores, and it practically stopped it instantly.  It was gone in a day or two.  It has a thicker consistency than regular honey, but is still very sweet.  I would recommend this honey for anyone with gastric problems or canker sores.",5
"I've tried lots of coconut oil over the years, but this brand is by far the best, so I keep coming back to it. The color is beautiful and white, and the smell is fresh and doesn't have the ""off"" scent some of the oils have. I love that it is organic and unrefined. I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my ""chicken skin""--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.  As a woman, I do NOT find them attractive at all. So, I highly recommend this oil for cooking, and for a wonderful moisturizer. Makes your skin feel young again--very smooth and not sticky at all. I find the price is great on Amazon too--what a bonus!",5
"I have been using this product for several months now, and am really pleased with it.  It smells very much of coconut when first opening it, but it does not flavor the food much if any - perhaps just the faintest hint of coconut.  I use it in place of olive oil as this has a higher smoking point than olive oil and so it does well when using higher heat.  I bake with it, roast red peppers, use it for sauteing veggies, anything that one would regularly use olive or canola oil for.  My only complaint is that the jars though sealed, always arrive greasy, surely a better packaging system can be used...this is why I gave it four stars instead of five.",4
"This is the highest quality of coconut oil on the market and the price can't be beat.  Coconut oil is a high heat oil so it won't burn your food like lower heat oils. Use freely for sauteing, frying and anywhere the coconut flavor is a plus. It's not overwhelming in flavor, just subtle. I've used it to deep fry battered fish and yum, so tasty. Also use it to make popcorn. Your popcorn won't burn and you'll get a really nice flavor. And, of course, you can use it on your skin, hair, etc. There are many benefits to coconut oil.",5
"It has a nice strawberry flavor, but the frosting drizzle you see in the picture is not what you get on the actual bar.  It is also too sticky.  There is a fine line you can cross with these granola bars and when you cross it, it can become too much.  The gooiness of the bar is a tad offputting at times.  The bar literally sticks to the wrapper and comes apart merely trying to open the wrapper.  That said, I really like the flavor.  Too often these rolled oat bars can taste bland despite any flavor profiles they claim to have.  This actually backs up the flavor it claims to have on the box, and I appreciate that above all else.  Texture may be an issue, but taste is not, which is why this gets four stars from me.  It is also healthier for you than other breakfast bars, and for those of us who like a low calorie snack that is filling, these are bars we can reach for.",4
"It truely is just a hint of coconut.  I taste for the most part mango and peach, which is the concentrated portion.  The ones that I received were filled to the top, I guess this is positive?  It also means I'm not able to shake the contents to mix it up.  I opened it to drink a little and tried to close it back, but it always results in some spillage.",3
very bad customer service.<br />my mother who is 86 years old bought one for her grandson who happens to be in the Army. She entered the wrong address on the order. She called aerogarden immeidately and Aerogarden customer service told her to order a second one and to fix the address problem on the second order.  Aerogarden could have EASILY rerouted the order to the correct address--she called within 10 minutes of placing the order.  They forced her to order a second one and then they made her pay for the freight to return it to them.  poor customer service all around. very unhelpful.,1
"I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.",4

"Too bad Seattle Best decided to do away with this coffee, it is the best ever.  One reason, the cinnamon is easy on the stomach and on the blood sugars.  Oh well, too bad people didn't realize how wonderful a coffee this is and now it is going away.  Thanks for offering the few that are left on Amazon.",5
"My family and I stumbled on this seasoning in our local grocery store. We LOVE to use it to season steak, burgers, ribs, even chicken!  The store stopped carrying it, so to Amazon I went. We highly recommend this as the best seaoning for meat!",5
"Love this seasoning. Great on fish. They use to sell it at Sams Club, but not anymore. It's even cheaper on Amazon.",5
I ordered these for breakfasts and snacks.  I love how easy and tasty they are and the nutrition that they provide.  Only point of contention is the size.  In comparison to the normal flavors the packets don't contain as much oatmeal.  It seems like it takes two packets to equal one packet of regular Maple and Brown sugar.  Still enjoy them and will buy more.,5
"I'd imagine this is what shaved particle board pieces, sprinkled w/cinnamon would taste like? Not pleased with the lack of forethought given, when item was shipped in a manila envelope w/zero padding. You can imagine it was mostly dust when I opened the bag. Overall not a good product, but then again , maybe I'm the minority?!? Skip this product.",1
"This snack is good, really good. The flavors aren't overwhelming. The texture is nice, crispy and crunchy. This is great for those times when you need a little something to stop the craving.",5
"After several issues including cracked nipples, poor latch, problems pumping, and a fussy baby I decided to start to ween at 3 weeks. By the time she was 4 weeks old I was down to two nursing sessions a day and supplementing with formula for the rest. Then, as I healed and felt less stress about nursing the whole process got easier so I decided to try to increase my nursing/pumping sessions and decrease her formula intake. Unfortunately, by that point I could only pump 1/4 ounce per breast and she was easily taking in 3 ounces per session with the bottle. I ordered a case of this tea and took the recommended dosage for 2 weeks without success. Then I tried increasing the dose to two bags at a time, 4 times a day. You do have to take the time to steep it corectly (10 minutes, covered). I saw minimal results after increasing the dosage which could have also been attributed to increasing the number of pumping sessions or additional water intake per day rather than the tea. If you're used to herbal teas you probably won't mind the taste too much. It's rather nice with a bit of milk and honey added in. It does smell faintly of black licorice, but I never noticed it in the flavor. After I finished off the case of tea I tried fenugreek capsules and saw a bit better improvement in supply (an additional 2-3 ounces per day). I can now pump about 4-6 ounces a day (up from a total of 2 ounces a day when I first started) while I'm at work and I nurse her at the start of every feeding at home. I still need to supplement with formula since she'll now take in between 4-6 ounces at a time at 3 months old. I wish I was one of the lucky ones to see an increase of 6-8 ounces per feeding/pumping session, but I'm happy that I was able to bring my supply back as much as I have. Now I'm combining Blessed Thistle with Fenugreek to see if I can get any additional output. 15 pills a day has been challenging for me, particularly since I'm not the best at swallowing them. I'm trying to hang on to my supply, as low as it may be, as long as I can though. So, for me it's worth it. Definitely give the tea a try if you're having trouble with supply, but just know that it has such low doses of the herbs that it isn't effective for everyone. If you don't have success with the tea it's worth trying out fenugreek and blessed thistle too.",2

"I was really hoping to enjoy this because it was well reviewed on Amazon.  However, I honestly couldn't even finish the cup of chai... the artificial sweetener taste was really bad.  If you are the type who doesn't mind artificial sweetener, then I would say go for it, but if sucralose bugs you at all, DON'T DO IT.  I guess I'll check the labels on my K-cups more carefully from now on.",1

"After feeding my dog IAMS chicken naturals for several months, I felt that it was time for a change to what I thought was better, less manufactured dog food. It is safe to say that my dog does not like this food one bit. She will eat my friend's dog food (which is Blue Mountain brand) but will only eat the Diamond Naturals unenthusiastically after what seems like days of letting the food just sit there. I also noticed that her coat lost much of its shine and lustre over the weeks that I was feeding her this food. I understand every dog is different but my dog is a Basenji-mix and I wanted to bring this to the attention of other Basenji owners. I thought I would be getting good quality food judging by the reviews but unfortunately this was not the case. I bought Nutro Ultra instead and she eats it immediately and seems to love it! Buy at your own risk.",1
"Brutus, my 3 year old pit bull, is such a heavy chewer he can destroy just about any toy in no time flat. The only toys that stand a chance with him are extreme Kongs, Nylabones, and the large size of the Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone. (NOTE: There is a medium/large size, but it's 7""; the large size is 9"", and that's preferable, IMO.) He loves chewing on the ends, he loves chewing on the big purple ball in the center, and he loves the gnawhide treats. And I love the fact that the toy lasts and lasts and lasts. Also, the fact that I can add in the gnawhide treats is a bonus because it seems to keep him more interested in the Bouncy Bone, compared to the Nylabones and/or Kongs.  With the Kongs, I can and do fill them with food and treats, and he'll play with them until the food is gone. But after that, he quickly loses interest. It's different with the Bouncy Bone; he'll keep on playing with it long after he finishes the gnawhide treats.<br /><br />Eventually, he was able to chew off one of the ends. But he now loves playing with the purple ball by itself, carrying it with him everywhere he goes. He likes it when I take it from his mouth and throw it in the house and/or backyard. He keeps bringing it back. And back. And....well, you get the picture. From now on, this is the only toy I'll ever get for him. He is a voracious eater, and is extremely motivated by food incentives. But he loves his Bouncy Bone even MORE than food, because instead of running straight to his food bowl in the morning, he runs right for his Bouncy Bone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for heavy chewers!!!",5
"This carousel is the perfect addition to the Keurig in cinnamon. I was concerned exactly how red the color would be but it's almost a perfect match.

On a negative note, the package is shipped via UPS which I absolutely hate. Should that stop you from purchasing this amazing carousel, NO!",5
"Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and brew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them.",1
I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase,1
"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.",5
my wife loves it. it is the only mg product that she takes willingly and according to her it nullifies all her period troubles.,5
"While I still serve Near East rice pilafs as a side dish, I now fix them for a quick and healthy weeknight meal! For most of them, I cook as directed in my small rice cooker (Cuisinart CRC-400 4-Cup Rice Cooker). Five minutes after I hear the water starting its boil, I add a cup of cut-up cooked protein (leftover chicken, turkey, chickpeas, beans, whatever) and a cup or so of chopped veggies (fresh broccoli, carrots, onions, frozen peas). When the rice cooker light tells me the rice is done, so is everything else! (If you use a long-cooking whole grain pilaf, you will want to add these ingredients later in the rice-cooking cycle to avoid over cooking.) I guess you could also mix the meat and veggies in after cooking them separately, if you prefer. This is enough to serve three adults (unless they are really, really hungry.)<br /><br />You can find recipes at the Near East website for other ideas.",5
Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  The candy inside was fresh too.  Very pleased with the price and the service.,5
I recommend everyone to buy it at the local stores it's much cheaper than this. I am going to return mine too!,1

"I love dark chocolate and loved this bar. I was afraid because I don't like coconut much, but it doesn't taste like coconut. My friend described it as ""extreme dark chocolate"" and suggested that it should only be used for baking, but I don't think you want to buy raw chocolate just to cook it.<br /><br />The only negative was that it was so small, for the price I wanted more, but I can understand that using high quality products has a cost. I recommend it.",5
"This is an awesome tea, but I found it much cheaper at my local organic grocery.  Order here if you need it and don't have time to run to the store, otherwise, stock up when you go to the grocery.",2
The usual disappointment...this is bad quality tea which has been artificially flavored.  It has a chemical taste and all that for a high price.  I can't recommend it.,1
"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!",3
"Smells wonderful, tastes great with a little sugar and vegan creamer.<br />Not as strong as I like but with Keurig cups, it never is.",4
"There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.

And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).",2
"This tea is yummy!  Unlike many of their fruit flavored teas, this one has no licorice in it (yeah!).<br /><br />Smooth berry flavors, but not too strong on any one flavor.  It gets better as it sits.  It can steep for a long time and not get bitter at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",5
These blend is good. The price is not competitive enough though compared to other retailers that carry CBTL. I'm hoping once CBTL pods are sold more widely the cost will go down in general. I recommend this particular blend for its strength without being too acidic.,4
"We have tried other natural dog foods, but they all had grain fillers in them and while our dog liked some of them she never reacted the way she does with this natural no grain dog food.

"I make wine on the side, and at first it took a lot of research and time.<br /><br />If your new at wine making, get this kit but be warned you will need more than just this kit. Besides the kit, you will need a glass carboy, plastic fermentor (plastic bucket), glass bottles 25-30, corker (to insert corks) and gas release knob (to vent gas, without getting the fermentor dirty). Everything else is optional, such as pump (recommended), funnels, thermometer, filters, heat gun (for shrinking covers), etc.<br /><br />Also, for a better taste create 5 gallons of the kit instead of 6 (simply stop adding water at the 5 gallon mark). A common word used in the instructions is ""MUST."" Its simply the mixture of water, grapes, and yeast.<br /><br />In sum, it will cost roughly $80-120 for all the equipment (that can be reused over and over) and $40 for this kit. Doing the math, it will cost $1.50 to $3.00 a bottle, not bad for table wine.",4

To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all.

Wasn't really impressed after spending nearly twenty dollars for it. Not much of a pumpkin type taste to it. More like a cinnamon taste. So to each their own.,2
"I love these and I'm glad SeaSnax is making them with olive oil and not canola or vegetable oil. I'm a paleo/primal eater and try to avoid all those nasty oils. These are perfect when you are craving something salty like chips or nuts, and the entire package only has 14 calories!

I have an Amazon subscription to these and the strawberry. My kids love them and they are better than other brands. I buy them from Amazon with a subscription and they are much less than in my local grocery store.,5
"Our family really enjoys Ricochet mints.  We have purchased a variety of Ricochet Mints and Raspberry, Cherry, Wintermint, and Peppermint are our favorites.  They are healthy too with no artificial color, flavors, or sugars.  They're even supposed to have positive oral health benefits since they are sweetened with Xylitol.",5
"Loaded with potassium and all kinds of trace minerals Zico is my first choice for re-hydration on those long hot bike rides.  We freeze Zico in the tetra pack and it makes great ice packs to keep the after ride food fresh in the cooler, then drink em down really cold;-)",5
"I love a nice full bodied Sumatra, but this one just didn't deliver all the satisfaction I wanted. I'm back to filling my solo cup with another Sumatra. Cute packaging, near perfect portion size, but left me wanting more.",3
"I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better.",1
I love this tea. It is delicious. It came in a timely manner and I was very pleased.,5
"Great quality! Good deal!<br /><br />This oat bran is awesome! Use it to make it as a breakfast cereal in the morning, with a little milk and stevia. Yum. And, very healthy!<br /><br />Buying my second batch :)",5
"The shampoo works well-- it cleans without stripping too much moisture from your scalp.<br /><br />However, as another reviewer commented, the Vine shipping method did not do this product any favors.  I received BOTH the shampoo & conditioner in a badly leaked state.  The shampoo had leaked quite a bit in the bag, which had punctured as well, so it was a big mess.<br /><br />The scent is much too heavy, imo.  It doesn't give me a headache (I'm sensitive to some scents), but it is quite potent.<br /><br />If the shipping problem would be resolved when the product is released, it would be a decent buy.",4
These are the only treats we give our three yorkies.  One of our yorkies has pancreatitis and IAMS is the only treat that we have found that doesn't cause her any distress.,5
"The description says ""ferret treats"" but the packaging says ""for dogs, cats and ferrets."" I give this daily to my 23 year old cat as a treat. Also to coax her to eat when she's not so interested in food, I crumble it on top of her food. She also likes their Chicken flavored Daily Dream Treats. A cat portion of either is only 1/2  a ""cookie"" so the bag lasts for months. Keep in the fridge.",5
"these are very good, and easy to take on the go.  They are light and not too salty.",5
Me and my kids love pirate's booty. It's a cross between popcorn and cheetos.  Only 130 calories for a decent size bag. Highly recommended!,5
"This has quickly become one of the ""staple"" seasonings I keep in my spice cabinet.<br />It is wonderful. I use it on all meats - grilled, oven baked, roasted....it really is one of the best! Only downfall...you have to use ALOT of it to get the best results.<br />I buy mine from Big Lots for 2 dollars each.",5
"After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.",5
"best coco water there is. I have tried all of them. Even though these are huge cans, it's still only about 170 calories- good calories! Perfect drink before or after hot yoga!",5
"I love this stuff. I'm practically addicted! I use the monthly delivery option and usually order an extra case half way through. It's great for hydration and a sweet treat after a long bike ride or even with a little white rum and pineapple after a long day. It's just soooo good. Try putting some in your rice cooker instead of water, just use a few tablespoons extra... DELICIOUS!!!",5
"I've been using this product for years now.  I use it in all kinds of foods and it really is out of this world good, but you really need to be mindful of the amount of salt in it, as I've used it in sauces and it was way too salty.  In the much smaller containers they have 40% reduced salt versions, which is what I use in my sauces now.  I just wish the reduced salt variety came in a 28 ounce container - I seem to go through a lot of this seasoning, because I use it very often.  Wonderful product, though. It's kind of my secret ingredient - couldn't cook without it!",4
I wasn't expecting much but I thought I would give this a try since coffee has been giving me problems. Very close to coffee taste. Was looking for something without caffeine and acid to go with morning muffins etc and this will do the job. will be buying this again and trying other teecino flavors. Absolutely amazed!!!!,5
"I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a ""tinny"" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.",1
"Pero is a grain base ""substitute"" for those who are trying to quit coffee or just want a very nice hot drink. It's good on its own, but my favorite way to fix Pero is to make a ""double"" cup's worth with two heaping teaspoons of Pero, one heaping teaspoon of cocoa powder, Stevia to taste, and a small pinch of salt (try it with and without - you will taste the difference). Sometimes I also add a pinch of cinnamon. Especially nice in the morning and evening, but I drink it whenever.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best price on the web.",5
"This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.",5
"My 8 months old loves this, but I just read the label this morning and discovered that it containes milk powder and it is made in China.  With all the recent recalls of milk products in China due to melamine contamination, I've decided not to give to my baby any more until I have evidence that it is safe.  Has anyone done any research on this topic?",2
if you use the store bought chili powder be careful when using this one can get hot fast,5
this is real costa rican coffee most stores label their coffee as it but they are not . this is a great tasting coffee one of the best i have had,5
What's not to like?  It's Reese's Candy Bars!  They are sweet and fattening and you get a lot of them!  Be careful if you are prone to over eating!  The whole box might do you in!,5
"The bars weren't bad, but they were a little too sweet for my taste especially when you get about 1/2 way through.  But the quality of the bars are good and there're big chunks of macadamia nuts which I thought were the best part.",3
"This was billed as a new flavor being carried on Amazon in August 2012. I bought it on a Gold Deal Special.<br /><br />I have 5 cats and they all absolutly love it. This spoiled group of kids are given their wet food at about 5 pm each evening. Kibble is available all day, but wet food is treat time.<br /><br />On the evening of the day I received this, I gave my inside kitties (4) a total of 6 three oz cans of wet food, with two of them being the Chicken, Tuna, and Wild Rice entree. Additionally, my outside kitty, who is Feral, but has been trapped and neutered, also got a can.<br /><br />All three can were immediately eaten and eaten before the other flavors; although, I did include  a Tiki flavor<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0MFX0"">TIKI Cat Napili Wild Salmon & Chicken in Chicken Consomme (Pack of 12 2.8 Ounce Cans)</a> and a Fancy Feast favorite which was a Talipia Appetizer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a> in the mix so I could be certain that the Pro Plan was being eaten because it was liked and Not because it was the only decent thing available. And to be totally fair, I put out Pro Plan favorites which were a Turkey and a Salmon: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TACYNG"">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Salmon, Shrimp and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CI96G"">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Turkey and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />It has been two or three weeks since I first received this Chicken and Tuna Entree made by Pro Plan. It continues to dissapear every night; although, a half dish of some flavors always make it to morning.And though the Chicken and Tuna is a great meal, the Pro Plan White Meat Chicken and Veggies is their favorite in the Pro Plan Chicken line up....at least so far:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TACZDU"">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, White Meat Chicken and Vegetable Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />So, I would recommend this to all my Amazon Friends' Kitties. My Kitties say your kitties will most likely love this IF THEY ARE CHICKEN eater...we know how delicate they all are. So, thank you from: Trinity, Gabriella, Wisdom,Mercy and ""Yellow Kitty...my feral guy.""",5
"We love Earth's Best products, but these are simply too dangerous. We first tried them with our daughter at 7mo old.  She quickly broke off nearly half the bar in her mouth.  She is now 10mo old, and we still have the same issue.  We cannot offer these to her any longer.  Too bad. the ingredients are excellent.  We don't have this issue with others such as Gerber and BeechNut.",1
My son loves these and I love them too because they dissolve quickly and are an easy snack to take anywhere.,5
"I bought the Veal demi-glace and Mushrooms demi-glace.  I didn't like the Veal at all, and will not buy it again.  I am not really please with the mushroom, but I added water and several mushroom cut in small pieces and it was much better.<br /><br />In clear, I will take the time to make my own mushroom broth and make my own chicken or meat broth, reduce it and make something similar to a demi-glace.  It will take some time but the result will be much better.<br />MP",2
i sent 2 messages to this seller about when there going to ship it out and every thing but never once got a reply.,1
"We have a Senseo coffee maker and my wife usually drinks decaf coffee, but she doesn't like the Senseo decaf.  After looking around, these Aloha Island pods seemed like a good (but comparatively expensive!) option, so we tried them.  She loves them - we're absolutely going to keep these on hand from now on.",5
"I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!",5
"This is an unusual tasting tea.  The combination of cocoa, black tea and other spices took some getting use to for me, but it was an immediate hit with my husband.  Definitely not for everyone, but great if you love exploring different taste combinations.",5
"I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.",1
"I just got my bamboo today.  It arrived so so quickly (that's why the shipping costs are so much- they ship it USPS, but it's SUPER quick; they're located in CA, and I got it in three days.  I'm in IL)  The bamboo arrived healthy, and looked just as tall as the picture shows, and very green.  Looks wonderful.  I also purchased some Super Green from KL Design & Import; and got that the same day too (highly recommend that to go with Bamboo)<br /><br />Anyway, my only disappointment was that the photo shows a lovely holding piece; looks almost like a dark wood or ceramic piece.  The one that it comes with is much lighter colored (look at the user pics) and has a random leaf printing on it.  It's not nearly as nice looking, so that is a bummer.  I wish it was darker.  That's my only complaint.  Will update if I have anything to add later on.  Still a great bamboo piece, and I recommend seller.  It will live in my office cubicle to brighten things up. :)<br /><br />EDIT: April 10th, 2012<br /><br />Just giving an update on this.  The bamboo is still healthy, and growing great.  My one disappointment was that the spiral piece that came with it has not grown at all since I got it.  It's still the same size, and with the same leaves.  It's still green and alive, but has not shot up and grown new leaves like the other two straight stalks.  I may actually break off the spiral part and let it grow more naturally.",5
"Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!",5
"I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating ""Lime and Chili"" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for.",4
"i was very disappointed when there were no tropical skittles, those are my favorite. Now i have alot of regular and a few of others",2
"Normally I assume that any bath product, other than epsom salt, which claims to be soothing and relaxing is just going to smell good and not be useful. The mustard bath exceeded my expecations. I tried it the day after a night of drinking, and after 15 minutes I had the urge to get out of the tub immediately and lie down. Took a 2 hour nap, and felt totally refreshed afterward. Definitely good for detox!",5
Instead of buying bags of this on a weekly basis I decided to be lazy and have amazon just send it to me in bulk. If you are looking for delicious organic granola at a reasonable price this is a worthwhile option.,5
It arrived my place in liquid state.<br />Don't buy any chocolate from internet if you live in Florida.,1
"So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.",1
"This is my second sampling of Davidson's organic teas, the first of which was the fantastic organic gunpowder green, and I must say that Davidson's has now completely won me over. I am not usually a huge fan of lemon, but I find the lemon myrtle provides the perfect touch. I don't notice the ginseng, but I don't care either way; in Chinese medicine, they say that ginseng is wasted on young people. $12 for a pound of quality loose tea is an incredible bargain, but the fact that it's organic makes it even better, and the 15% off from ""Subscribe & Save"" knocks this one out of the park!",5
"Devil Dogs were one of my favorite treats as a kid.  I had someone send me some about 10 years ago and they were just as I remembered.  However, since the company was taken over by Hostess, they taste like crap.  I literally threw away the unused portion.",2
"I thought I will get some flavorings to delicately flavor the sparkling water. I was wrong. What I got are syrups to turn sparkling water to a Coke, Diet Coke, Root Beer, etc. I ended up throwing away the flavorings.  If you want to drink Coke, bettre just buy a can at your grocery store!",1
"Well,the bad news is, I think my cat is on to me.. I was anxious to try these after reading the good reviews on Amazon. So I bought the treats at a chain pet store and paid a lot more. Anyway, I let my cat smell the bag first and she seemed very interested. Then I gave her one empty pocket with no meds. She loved it. So, when the time came  was for her next pill, I gave her one pill pocket with the pill and a regular treat inside.  She ate it,no problem.<br />Now, I  temporary had to give her meds everyday and she is catching on. She eats the treat and spits out the pill!! I do not know what I am going to do. I guess I will have to force it on her by syringe. Maybe she will go back to taking the pill pocket...",3
This is a wonderful product that I have been using for several years. The blend of favors is a great alternative to Italian dressing.,5
Wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar - their coffees are smooth and delicious and Jamaica Me Crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market. Island coconut is quite poor in comparison.,4
I have a beautiful Siberian husky.  She is my constant friend and companion and loves her treats.  Her ultimate treat is duck jerky.  Heaven forbid I should ever fail to provide her with these delights.  She knows where they are kept and never fails to tell me when it's time to reward her.  Thank you.,5
I ordered several whole seed spices and was very pleased with their freshness. Grinding just what you need only takes a minute and the payoff is worth the effort. Shipping time was excellent and everything came well packaged. I wouldn't hesitate to order again.,5
"I love this product. I use it in my smoothies. It gives the smoothies a richer, creamier texture and taste. The other brands I have purchased locally were grainy and not as good as this one as well as twice the price of this prodcut! Thanks!",5
"I picked Delallo because it was offered on Amazon Prime, had one good comment and was comparatively inexpensive.  I'm  a bit disappointment because based off of the other comment and product description, I was expecting this olive oil to be noticeably unfiltered.  I have reservations if this is even unfiltered olive oil and just a false description by the seller.<br /><br />I've posted a couple pics but I can't see a single spec of anything in it (yes, I shook the heck out of it).  Nor does Delallo's website make any suggestion that this bottle of olive oil is unfiltered.",1
"This product is a complete waste of time and money.  Me and a friend tried it with a bottle of wine and it had absolutely no noticeable effects whatsoever on either one of us.  We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.  After my experience with this product, I am convinced the other reviews are either shill reviews or from inexperienced users who merely received a placebo effect from this product.",1
"I've been using the Pacific Lab products for the past two years and have really noticed an improvement in my overall recovery levels.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Try the lemonade flavor, the fruit punch is not so great.",5
"I bought these at a lower price somewhere else and they are awesome. Of course they will be all broken when you order online, they are hard cookies!",5
"This is the best Made in Oregon jam I have ever tasted.  There is one in the market, but is hard to locate.",5
I love these almonds!  Wish they sold them somewhere locally so I didn't have to buy them in bulk over the internet.,5
"This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive.",5
This is a long time favorite.............I drink a lot of tea and this is my favorite flavored black.  The aroma is delicisous!!,5
PureBites Chicken treats are the best. Had previously been using Halo but found my cats vomiting from the last few batches. Found the Purebites and have no longer had any stomach issues with the kitties. Plus the dog loves them too.<br />The crumbles at the bottom are great over their meals when everyone gets a bit finicky so there's no waste!,4
"This product offers an amazing amount of nutrition, is very easy to prepare, versatile, and so inexpensive.  Adapts to a large variety of herbs and spices for using by itself or combining with rice, lentils, and assorted other grains.  A fine and ancient food.",5
These are the most tasty multi-grain crackers I have found.  I eat them AND use them as NON-FATTENING treats for my dogs (per the Vet's orders) ...  most pet treats are pretty fattening and not nearly as healthy as these puffed cakes.,5
So glad I ordered a Pack of 6 Beaver Extra Hot Jalapeno Mustard.  I gave several of our friends a bottle of it to take home. They also plan on purchasing more through Amazon.  A great product!!  I highly recommend the Jalapeno Mustard.,5
Chinese made products are beyond questionable when it comes to dog edibles. I was disappointed to read these too are China made. My dog's health and life is worth a more. I will stick to non toxic and good quality controlled foods for my dogs.,1
"After saying goodbye to chips about a year ago I've missed them.  Chips taste amazing am I right?  The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars",4
"This product is the same price as a bag of 15 to 20 bully sticks and yours comes 4 in a package for this price.  It was my mistake to not see 4 in a package but I saw instead 12"" bully sticks with a photo of a large bag of bully sticks.  Very deceptive.  Why not put a photo of the 4 bully sticks one receives.  I will never buy them from you again.",1
I was thinking about school starting and what would be good to put in the kids lunch boxes.  I came across this organic snack line.  Tried a box to see if the kids would enjoy them and they did.  I love that it is a fruit vegetable combination.  I try so hard to give my kids a healthy option and feel like I can do that with this snack.,5
"Didn't taste as good as I wanted, but still good considering the fact that it is only a healthier meal bar than a bag of chips!",3
"I purchased a 12-pack of Kashi GOLEAN Peanut Butter & Chocolate bars for myself and my family. We tried one and nobody wanted to finish it. It tasted way too much like a ""power"" bar. I didn't expect a candy bar, but there are some healthy bars that taste good. The bars sat in our kitchen for a few weeks before we threw the rest (11) away. What a nasty tasting waste of money! I contacted Kashi about returning the bars, but they just sent me a few coupons for some free bars. We tried some other flavors, but they weren't much better. I would rather have had my money back.",1
"Gloria Jean's is the cheap-o brand for the Keurig machine, and it shows.  They've got the honesty to say (on their regular 24-pod box) ""with the subtle taste of hazelnut.""  Boy, IS it subtle!  Not only is the flavoring weak, but the coffee itself isn't strong at the lowest (6 oz) setting and forget the 8 oz level; you might just as well be reusing pods.<br /><br />When we first got the Keurig, we got it with a selection of Green Mountain coffees.  I thought these were first-class but kind of pricey - you can get Gloria Jean's around here for about $.36 a pod.  This saves a fair amount if you go through 6-8 pods a day, but for the difference in quality, I just don't think it's worth worrying about.  If you have to have your coffee fix so you can get out the door, keep a couple boxes of Gloria Jean's around in case you run out of the good stuff, but don't use it regularly, or you'll find yourself giving up on your Keurig machine!",2
"THIS PRODUCT BEATS ANY SCONE MIX ON THE MARKET.  BEING IRISH, I KNOW HOW A GREAT SCONE SHOULD TASTE.  I CONTINUE TO PURCHASE AND TELL MY FRIENDS.",5
"Really good for the price, I'm starting to like this more than other energy drinks. Being that I can buy these for about 50 cents a pop verses, a buck for other  generics, or 2 to 3 bucks for name brand stuff, these are a steal. Dig it. This is the best flavor most definitely, but if you want them cheaper get the multiple flavor pack.",5
I love raspberries and this tea does not disappoint.  Herbal teas meet our water needs and why not with some favorite flavor.  If you enjoy raspberries ~ you will enjoy this tea.,5
I bought this to compliment my growing Stash Tea collection at the office. Like my friends they expected a sharp lemon taste with this tea however upon trying it you notice the ginger seems to have the stronger taste. I like the tea though - it is a strong tea (former black coffee drinker here) if you let it sit for awhile. Definitely recommend.,4
This decaf coffee is delicious and the price was super and the delivery was very fast.  I will order from them when my current supply is running low.  Thanks!,5
"Timothy's Hazelnut decaf  is the best, Great flavor, smooth, just wonderful.  Everyone loves it.  Thanks for a great decaf hazelnut.  Love the K cups, I drink more coffee and love it.",5
"There is something, some taste that I remember, seems to be missing. Generally, it's good. Thanks.",3
"This stuff is terrible, I order the one pack which should be includes 6 boxes, but I only received one. don't buy anything from this tiger tiger, terrible experience!<br />by the way, I saw this kind of thing happened on other customers, but I didn't pay attention to it. because I think it is just radom mistake, but now I changed my mind. Don't buy it!!!",1
"This is perhaps my favorite kcup flavor. We put milk, ice and a dash of peanut butter with this coconut coffee into a blender to make a to-die-for latte. Makes a great summer cooler.",5
"I'm not normally a fan of flavored coffees, but this one won me over.  The underlying coffee flavor is mild and balanced, with hints of caramel.  The coconut flavor balances well of that - it's not too heavy, but you can definitely taste it with each sip, and the aroma is pure coconut coffee heaven.<br /><br />This is a ""seasonal blend"" that is not currently available directly from Green Mountain, but I'm delighted that you can still get it here.  Well worth a try.",5
"Bought two cases, did not realize it was 12 in a case.  Tried three cans, large escargots, delicious, just make up butter seasoning,a drop of wine (optional), put in baking dish and bake at 10 min in 400 degree over.  Voila! Great appetizer and great price.  Gave 1/2 dozen to sister as a present - she loved them, I love them.  Can imagine sitting on the Champs, eating a dozen with baguettes.",5
"A waste of money to purchase these snails.  They come from Indonesia, not France.  and only exactly 12 per can. Don't absorb the garlic marinate well and are tough and chewy.",1
This is one of the few mixes I like better then my own homemade chili.  They really hit the nail on the head.,5
"My dogs love this high quality treat. The ingredients are wholesome. I also use Natural Balance dry dog food because it is a healthy, nutritious food and rated highly by dogfoodadvisor.com.",5
"I have one of the small, Nostalgia-brand cotton candy makers that uses either crushed candy or flossing sugar.  While I like the results of the crushed candy, I've really been craving the more traditional cotton candy flavors, and was curious about the results I'd get with flossing sugar.  I was really pleased!  You do need to take a bit of care to not spill the sugar (because it's so fine, it starts melting instantly, and can be a mess if you miss the target),but the results - flavor, volume, and texture - were fantastic.  Try blending the flavors, too.  We did so, unintentionally, when we first received the sugars: we wanted to try them all, and used one right after the other.  Got some very novel blends that way!  :-)",5
"This is excellent tuna. I like the 3-ounce cans for carrying in my snack bag or purse - makes a good meal in the car, just add some chips. (Be careful not to spill the oil on your clothes though.)<br /><br />I like the fact that this tuna does not contain soy or other fillers.",5
"Thees crackers are the best, they taste great and are healthy too.  My only issue is with the price; although this a good price on this product, Target sells them every day for lower.  Target usually sells them for $2.39 a box (times 12 would be 28.68), and often they go on sell for $2.00 a box.  One time I even saw them for as low as $1.90 a box!  I love these crackers, and I highly recommend them; I just can't see the point in ordering them from amazon when I can get them at my local Target for less.",4
I have purchased this product from a number of vendors over the past three years.  Most of the time the product arrives broken up or mashed together due to poor packaging.  Not this time!  The products were properly packaged with just the right amount of padding.  I will definitely reorder.  Nice job!,5
Our dogs love these treats and 2 years ago were made in the U.S.  We thought we were giving them something healthy until we read the package and saw that they were now made in China.  We are now looking for a similar product made in USA.,1
"I have opened hundereds ifnot thousands of cans of peeled italian tomotoes and for the money these are as good as i have ever had; as good or better than Campania pomidori pelati; very red, rich, and sweet.",5
"I was given about 5 bags of this flour (I have celiac disease) by a loved one. I've tried making everything from cookies to waffles to bread and cakes. Everything looks amazing, but has a strange, sweet, extremely unpleasant aftertaste. I'm going to throw out the rest of it.",2
"Having been diagnosed a Type II Diabetic, real sugar is out of the question for me anymore; so, the hunt began. And, like most other Diabetics, I've tried 'em all... every sugar substitute on the market.<br /><br />DiabetiSweet is THE ONE. It Tastes just like sugar. Leaves No Aftertaste, just like sugar. Cooks and Bakes, just like sugar. And Measures spoon-for-spoon, cup-for-cup, just like sugar.<br /><br />I use it, sparingly, in my coffee and tea, and on my cereal.<br /><br />I use it to make cookies, candy, and ice cream.<br /><br />I use it to make cake, cobblers, pies, and coffeecake.<br /><br />I use it to make rice pudding, jello, chocolate mousse, and cr&egrave;me brulee (baked custard with the broiled, or torched, sugar on top... substituting DiabetiSweet of course).<br /><br />I've put it in my food processor, pulsing it a few times, to get it more finely grained like Superfine Sugar (what is commonly called 'Baker's Sugar').<br /><br />I use it for all the things we know and love that are designated: Sinfully Sweet. And you would not know you're eating something sugar-free.<br /><br />I gave DiabetiSweet FOUR (4) STARS for the simple reason that, if you eat too much of it, you WILL get gas; and I mean hard, rumbling, can't-hold-it-in-at-all gas. Get ready to be hugely embarrassed if you're in public.<br /><br />If you go over the gas limit, you'll then find yourself living in the bathroom for the next 3 hours. Imodium becomes your new best friend.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the downside of DiabetiSweet. It just runs right thru you. So, you have to play with it to see what your limits are.<br /><br />In my particular case, it goes like this: 2 small scoops of ice cream, I'm fine. 3 scoops, I've got gas. 4 scoops and I've become one with my toilet, *lol*<br /><br />I will not give up my DiabetiSweet because of the possibility of these nuisances. I've just learned what my body can handle, and what it can't.<br /><br />Which, if looked at from another perspective, is a good thing; for no one has any business eating 4 scoops of ice cream, a 1/2 dozen cookies, or more than 1 slice of cake, cobbler, or pie.<br /><br />Just like real sugar's harmful effects (obesity, hypo-hyperglycemia, empty calories, etc etc), DiabetiSweet should be used very judiciously. It is, after all, a 'treat' not a 'staple'.<br /><br />Enjoy.",4
"It's okay tasting crab meat, but understand that it's not a 13 oz can of meat.  It's an 8 oz can of meat with 5 oz of water in it to make your 13 oz. Do a zoom and look at the label.  Big difference.  That works out to 38.5% water you're buying.  Most of the other brands are 6 oz cans with 4.25 oz meat and 1.75 oz water making those 29% water, making the Crown Prince can roughly 1/3 more water than most other brands.  It's not misstated, so no reduction in stars for dishonesty or anything.  I just think that any product that is comprised of nearly 40% water and advertised as 13 oz is not as good a deal as they are attempting to portray.<br /><br />I didn't look at the zoom pic dry weight before buying.  I've bought it here locally by the dry pound and water weight is extra.  So I was thinking I could fudge a bit on my recipe that calls for one pound of meat (yeah, I know it's cheating), throw in a slight extra bit of filler, and save a few bucks.  Unfortunately for me, it goes the other way because I have to use two cans to get that pound.  Live and learn.<br /><br />Factor that in when you are comparing prices.",3
"How exactly do you rate dog food? I'm not a dog nutritionist nor a vet. What I do know is I have 2 dogs, a long hair chihuahua and a sheltie mix. I feed them typically 4Health dog food I buy from my local Tractor Supply and the dogs love it. I had the chance to try this food for my dogs and I mixed it with my current dogs food as to not shock them. I will say both dogs ran over and chowed down on the food and ate only the Beneful leaving their original kibble.<br /><br />So the food appears to get a seal of approval from my dogs. I also checked and it looks like this food is made in the USA which is important to me. With all the dog food and treat issues coming from over seas I want to keep my dogs eating stuff made in the USA, sure the pet food standards aren't as high, but they are higher then imported food so I don't feel so worried feeding them this food.",4

"I bought this formula thinking I'm buying the best for my 8 month old. Even though this wasn't available in the smaller 8oz size which I would have prefered to ensure that my son liked it, I went ahead and bought it since he's not a fussy baby and easily took Similac and Enfamil earlier.<br /><br />I used formula only to supplement breastfeeding and gave about 2-4oz of this daily to my son for 4-5 days. During this time, we noticed that he was very cranky and didn't slepe well, would scream even in his sleep and keep curling up and rolling in bed, sort of banging his face and head on the mattress. I attributed this to teething or constipation. But when over the weekend I did not supplement at all, he was completely fine. Then to test, I gave it to him again after he had been fine for a couple of days and had also pooped well. Even after just 2 oz in the afternoon, he started doing the same thing...screaming, rolling in bed, unable to sleep well.<br /><br />I also read that there is an issue with the way the DHA is obtained, using some toxic chemical, when researching this formula to find if other mom's had seen the same issue with their children. I give it a 2 rating as I don't know if it just didn't suit my child or if there is something not good in the formula.",2
"These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.",4
"I am so glad i bought a case of these! These veg sausages have now become my tastiest and favorite veg meat alternative.<br /><br />Unlike the other worthington offerings i have tried which dont really taste like the real meat comparison, these delicious veggie sauseges VERY CLOSELY taste like the real thing.<br /><br />They have a great smokey flavor and just the right amount of mild spicey seasoning.<br /><br />I suggest NOT to microwave..these definitly need to be pan fried and you will be pleased with the taste and texture of these delicious links.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",5

"Bentley's Unflavored White Tea used to be the best white tea ever. Subtle delicious flavor. They used to have the green labels back then. When they moved to the black labels, the quality went down. Now they have a third version with a new black label, which is even worse. It takes two bags to make a cup and the taste is no where near the original. I've tried writing to Bentley and have had no response from them. I'm cancelling my subscription.",1

"I love this Licorice Bridge Mix. I remember my Nana always having some of this around when I was little. I bought it to put in some Apothecary jars for decoration. I love the bright colors mixed with the pretty pastels and the black licorice jelly beans. My favorite pieces by far are the multi-colored sprinkle covered gum drops which I wish there were more of in the mix. Because there aren't very many of the gum drops, I place them around strategically to show them off better. This bridge mix also tastes good too. The little pastel pieces remind me Good and Plenty. Yum!",5

"I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a ""Wood Grain"" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did.",1

"Disappointing. My Wife and I picked this up hoping to sample a variety of coffee with our new Keurig, and find the flavors we liked. Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called ""sampler"" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors.",2

This shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed Whiskas Purrfectly chicken he won't consider anything else.  He prepares to eat if I offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he's sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away.  He won't eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive. The pouch is not convenient but the fact that I know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it.,5

"We bought these by accident, we thought they were stevia based THEY ARE NOT, that being said, they are delicious. My 11 year old really loves these and they are a bargain. Do I like having sweets around the house, no, that being said these are really good and the flavors are really different. The adults also prefer these to the other brands available (we are taste not price sensitive as we eat so few) even the ""original"" Haribo's so if you want something different and really delicious, these are exceptional.",5
"I ordered this strickly for convenience.  As the winter approaches, I like to have my kitchen stocked because when it is dangerous weather, I want to just come straight home.

"This ginger is a very high quality, however, it is not packaged in Australia and California as they claim. It is a product of China. If you order this, you can expect to receive several broken jars, and a dripping, sticky mess. Amazon cannot take the time to label this item as glass or fragile, so the postal service it going to handle it as if it were a box of books. The packing material was 3 air pack bags, they were so tightly packed inside the outer container they were all popped. And the inner container was filled with a sticky mess of broken jars and tiny glass shards. Only 9 of mine arrived intact and the outer container was such a sticky mess I had to put it inside a plastic garbage bag to put it in my vehicle.",2

YUM! I can even chew little pieces of ginger in them.  My mouth is rather alive at the moment, sort of like eating a piece of real ginger or candied ginger. I can see that there's a limit to how much I want to eat, but I like ginger and well, they don't skimp on flavor!<br />  I have to say that really, on a cold night with a hot drink... these are addicting!<br />Okay... I need to put them down now.... yes... that's what I'll do, but maybe have one more first...",4
Ok this is the 2nd can of this in a different flavor that we tried...and when it arrived the top of the can was totally covered  in black spots...my guess would be rat urine or some kind of bug droppings...it was utterly disgusting. I read on the news this week where a lady just died from rat urine being deposited on a soda can and it just made me cringe...we did not drink it out of the can as we never do...but my main concern is ..why would they ship out a product in that condition???? The juice wasnt horrible but it was unhygenic. I was disappointed.,2
"Tastes great!  Sure the amount in each varies slightly, but VERY slightly.  Tastes great and isn't very chunky there are a few now and then, but I didn't expect perfection anyway.  I'd definitely buy it again!",5
"That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!",5
These are delicious treats for people of all ages. I got $100 for eating these and they were surprisingly delicious. I would seriously recommend getting these for snacks for a party or just using to gross out your friends. the maggots and the scorpion suckers also made by this company are also delicious.,5
"I love the convenience of ordering Grape Nuts from Amazon, but something has to be done with how they rotate their stock. I placed an order on 6/24/2011 and was very pleased that the expiration date of the cereal was 5/05/2012. Imagine my surprise when I placed a 2nd order on 12/21/2011 and the expiration date was 5/02/2012. How is it that 6 months later you are fulfilling with older cereal?",3
"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.",5
"I admit I bought this because it was on sale (only $9 for 6 boxes!) and because I'd read generally positive reviews of Dilmah teas.  It seemed worth trying, anyway.  It's a pretty good tea with a generic fruity flavor to it that isn't identifiable as anything in particular -- the label says strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry flavors.  I'm guessing it makes a good iced tea although I've only tried it hot so far.  I'm sure I'll finish up the carton but probably won't re-order this since I really prefer my fruit teas with more distinctive flavors.",4
"My husband loves hot sause, especially made from Habanero.  His favorite was Twisted Pepper brand but they quit making it so we have been on a search.  Recieved this yesterday and he tried it with his eggs this morning.  He gave it a thumbs up so we will be purchasing it again.",5
"I ordered these chocolates directly from Xylitol USA.  They had turned white on the outside, something I have known in the past to be a sign of age.  I ate 4 anyway and got a belly ache.  I am used to using xylitol daily in my tea, so it was not an issue of not being used to it.  I called the company and was told the chocolates were fine, that the white coating happens sometimes in shipping.  Funny, I've never received any other shipped chocolates that turned white, have just seen it before on out of date chocolates.  I told her they gave me indigestion and she said people should eat no more than one a day because they contain a lot of xylitol.  Shouldn't that be a warning on the package?  So I tried just eating one.  Belly ache again.  And I was denied a refund or even a discount on my next xylitol order!  Guess they don't want my business.",1
"I have tried many different brands of espresso over the years, this is the best of the best. It has a very rich flavor, slightly bitter, but not too much. And the aroma, it makes the entire house smell fantastic! I use a stovetop espresso maker, as well as a DeLonghi espresso maker. The Lavazza comes out perfect in either case. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone.",5

"This is an 'okay' sauce. Not bad, not great, just okay.<br /><br />I was expecting more of a pepper kick but it's kind of mellow. Being mellow isn't a bad thing for most people, but I expected a bigger kick from the jalapeno's.<br /><br />I tried the sauce on taco's, french fries, grilled chicken, and a lonely, burnt hamburger. It worked well on all these items, but surprisingly, it was really good on the fries. But I like mayonnaise on my fries, so go figure.<br /><br />If your looking for a ranch type sauce with a little pepper kick then this is for you. If you're looking for a jalapeno sauce to kick you 'in-the-you-know-whats' then try something else.",4
"I found this sauce to be a bit bland for me.  If I want jalapeno, I really want a kick.  The flavor wasn't stellar either.  The general consensus at the table was that it was just ok.",3
"This slightly creamy sauce has quite a good flavor and you can definitely taste the jalapeno in it. Good news is that it's moderately spicy, so it adds a lot of flavor and some ""kick"" without overdoing it and making your food so hot you can't taste it. I was pleasantly surprised because I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from a product with the Taco Bell name on it, but it tastes quite good. I've found this sauce quite good for seasoning ground beef for homemade hamburger patties.",4
I agree with other reviewers.  I don't know how Amazon can sell these.  I just bought 5 packs from CVS.com for $77 (of course after coupons).,3
"I compared the price of these tubs with the original cans ounce for ounce and it is only a couple of cents more expensive to buy this product. I like the tubs becuase they are cleaner, keeps you from putting your hands in the formula to get the scoop. Also, I live 50 miles from the nearest store that sells formula or diapers and if I happen to get there to buy any their cost is several dollars higher than Amazon.com. For those of you who like to complain about the few cents it costs less at your local Target, Wal-mart, Etc....be thankful and remember Amazon is paying to ship it to your door. Thank you Amazon.com",5
"This tea may be an acquired taste - because this is much stronger and much more bitter than any tea normally purchased in the US.  I would definitely recommend using milk, which then takes all the bitterness away without losing the strength of taste.<br /><br />I would not recommend it for iced tea.<br /><br />However, if you like strong hot tea, and if you are prepared to have milk in your tea, I think this is the best possible tea, at least at any reasonable price.<br /><br />It is wonderful that this tea is now available from Amazon, at a reasonable price, with rapid delivery, and with options to have it shipped regularly at a reduced price.",5
"my cat is a very picky eater, she will not touch human food and it was very hard to find her a cat food that she actually liked and would eat. As for treats same thing, she would not eat every kind. I bought a pack of temptations to try her and she goes crazy for them, i once left a package of them on my coffee table and went out and when i got back the cat had knocked them off the table and ripped the bag open and ate them all. (i think that these are equivalent to smoking to humans) its very addictive to cats.. 5 stars.. *****",5
"Our cats are definitely tempted by Temptations!  I was delighted to find that Temptations had come out in a ""Greenie"" dentable form.  All five of our kitties love them and they are like ""crack"" for cats.  The Whiskas Temptations line of treats are a favorite among our felines.<br /><br />Love to see my cats run around and chase these things!  Stuffed delights for them!  Cats love 'em and they are supposed to provide good dental hygiene for them.",5
"I think that, unless there has been a change in the recipe, people who rate this product highly are confusing aroma with flavor.  This ""coffee"" has a wonderful aroma as it brews, but it has no taste at all.  In fact, while I can smell the pumpkin spice, I can not distinguish the taste of this stuff from simple hot water.  To give it any flavor at all, I need to add a creamer and/or some sugar to it, or maybe even a little brandy.  That is a very bad thing (not the brandy), since I like my coffee black without any additives at all.<br /><br />If Green Mountain wants to make a mild ""flavored"" coffee rather than a medium or bold flavor, that's ok, but the very least they should do is use their breakfast blend as a starting point and work from there with their various spices. Until then, I'm sorry, but as much as I would like to do so, I can not recommend this product to anyone who likes the taste of coffee.",1
Esposito's sage sausage is a breakfast type sausage.  We cut off big chunks and either butterfly and pan fry or grill.  The taste is wonderful. Esposito's customer service is terrific.,5
I love this green tea is very healthy and the teast is so good. I have oder so many different taste to last me a good year!!,4
"I'm a fan of strawberry Instant Breakfast, but it's very hard to find.  The stores in my area don't seem to carry anything other than chocolate and vanilla.  Six 10-count boxes of strawberry was just what the doctor ordered!",5
I order these cracklins and when I got them I was happy until I open a bag and bite into one they were so salty I couldn't even eat them and it wasn't just the one bag every bag was the same I feel as tho I wasted my money and I spent $60.,2
"This chocolate, when fresh, is delicious.  I love this brand. Or did until today.<br /><br />It arrived today from Bengalla Organic Wholesale.  Apparently they sent out the oldest chocolate in stock.  It has a waxy film on it and tastes awful.  I called them immediately to tell them about the problem, but they will not send me new chocolate or give me a refund.<br /><br />I am so disappointed because it cannot be eaten.  I tried, but it is really bad.<br /><br />My advice, buy this from a whole foods store in your city.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Good news:  Amazon was kind enough to efund me the purchase price.  So while Bengalla gets 0 stars, Amazon gets 5 stars!  THANKS AMAZON.",1
Love these chewy candies. Vendor price was reasonable and they shipped very quick. I will order more soo nas i already ate them.,5
"This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant.  I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it.  As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.  It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor.  Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks.  The advertising is irresponsible, in my view.  No more Yogi products for me.",1
"This is what National Pet Pharmacy does to con you into buying a smaller bag at a ridiculous price:<br />I was looking for a 40 pound bag of Science Diet Sensitive Stomach Dog Food.  What I found was that the price Petco and others charge on Amazon and what National Pet Pharmacy charges for the bag plus shipping is almost the same.  So I figure I'll save a couple bucks and go with National Pet Pharmacy.  What I didn't realize was that they have this little trick where they put their 20 pound bag up at a similar price that other sellers sell their 40 pound bag for.  So they price their 20 pound bag (which they hope people will mistake for a 40 pound bag - like me, haha) a couple bucks cheaper than the others charge for their 40 pound bag.  So when you shop around if you're not careful you'll assume they're the best deal for the 40 pound bag at a price a few bucks cheaper.  Then you get the box from them and it's the 20 pound bag that you realized you paid way too much for. I just sent it back but of course now I'm out the shipping both ways.  So much for the hours spent finding the cheapest dog food online.  I'll just go to J&B's from now on.",1
"I am a coffee lover and I felt in love with this one since since my Vietnamese friend introduced me to it. I still add Splenda or sugar to it but it is not necessary . A great product for home/ work, etc.",5
"As stated in the title, the chocolates were definitely edible, but did not look all that great. They had patches of white (?wax) on the surface, as well as some were dented or misshaped. They looked like they had been stored in a place that was a little to warm and they started to melt before they were shipped.",3
"Ok, to tell you the truth, after a read Mad Max's review, with a discussion of all the chemicals in this product, I am just a wee bit scared of this stuff. Are all these things necessary in something to bathe in?<br /><br />I have a couple of other issues with it as well. Personally, I thought the smell of it was very strong. Yes, I guess they want it to smell manly, but this stuff was rather overpowering.<br />Wouldn't it just be easier to make something with a very faint odor or no scent that perhaps the entire family could use and then if you would like to add a scent to oneself...aftershave or cologne or perfume, depending on ones gender, you could choose to do so. All these layers of scent seem just a bit much.<br /><br />And I also think the packaging is awkward.",2
I would surely recommend this product. It is a great product for men of any kind of skin.<br />I love this product.,5
"Like for many reviewers, initially this product was fantastic. Besides the smell that made me sneeze slightly, my skin became soft within a few days. I was recommending this product to everyone at that point. A few months later, I started having breakouts: I had not had any pimples in over 20 years. My skin started to itch more and more. I thought initially I was attacked by some type of microscopic bugs all over my body. It became unbearable. I finally made the connection with the soap. Smelling it was making me sneeze more and more. My skin was burning after each shower. It was as if I was washing my face and body with laundry detergent.<br />Allergies develop over time. It is often hard to make a connection with the allergens. As soon as I switched to another brand, the symptoms disappeared. I was taught in medical school that Dove is amongst the safest hypoallergenic products. This new line of products for men is to the contrary incompatible with my skin. I don't have any other allergies.I don't know if the regular white bar is still as safe as it used to be, Unilever lost my trust for ever. Just look at the ingredient list if you are still sceptical.",1
"Tried LOTS of hot sauces.. THIS one has the right thickness, texture & taste for me. Believe me, I tried dozens and found this one 15 year's ago and STILL using it.",5
The British tea shoppe.com is an excellent seller. and this blackberry apple preserves is perfect! i used on scones with clotted cream and i'm not really a preserves/jelly/ jam person but this has a sweet mild blackberry flavor and is really good quality i just loved it. in fact i'd buy ANY thursday's cottage product based on the quality of this one!,5
"My puppy didn't like going to his crate in the mornings and he would scream until he finally wore himself out.  Enter the kong stuff'n.  Ever since I started filling his kong up with this stuff in the mornings, he can't wait to get into the crate.  It's not like I use it to trick him in there either...he goes in on his own and sits until I give him the kong.  It's amazing!  Highly recommended!",5
"WOW!  I grew up hating oatmeal - thought it was slimey and reminded me of wallpaper paste.  Could only tolerate it when used as an ingredient in cookies, meatloaf, etc.  First time I ate Silver Palate Oatmeal I was amazed at the difference.  There was actual taste and texture that was good!  I've since tried other rough cut, minimally processed oatmeals but I keep coming back to Silver Palate.  Sometimes I even get a craving for this oatmeal - which I would never have imagined could happen to a confirmed oatmeal hater.",5
"1st off, this product is the best, the consistency, the flavor, just a great over all product, second, Amazon delivered this product so fast, it was here in just 2-days and arrived on Saturday to boot.<br /><br />Thank you,Thank you again for a great product delivered colicky split !<br /><br />The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00238ZZDO"">The Silver Palate Oatmeal, Thick & Rough, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)</a>, Thick & Rough, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)<br />by Silver Palate",5
"I love oatmeal, so was really looking forward to this stuff; Silver Palate products usually do not disappoint.  Just made a batch, stovetop.  Per directions.  Had to throw the whole thing out: it tasted rancid and stale, was inedible.  Checked box expiration date, just in case; but it is well within ""freshness"" period.  I have written to the company.  Will not buy again.  Back to McCann's, which may not be quite as ""wholesome"" (""thick and rough"") but at least it's fresh!",1

"Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a ""C"").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food",1
"I scoured the internet looking for a healthier protein shake and came across Svelte.  I remember seeing it at Whole Foods because I loved the packaging and the fact that its resealable so I didn't have to drink it all at once.  That's where the positives for me stopped though.<br /><br />Svelte boils down to soy milk , sugar alcohols, and sugar!  I took one to the gym and my trainer looked at the bottle, laughed and handed it back to me saying ""just buy some soy milk, it's cheaper, you get the same protein and probably tastes better.""  He then went on a rant about how much he doesn't like soy protein.  I don't care about that part as much but the taste was really artificial.  My favorite one was cappuccino, chocolate and vanilla tasted really bad and the spiced chai one was even worse.<br /><br />Folks, don't waste your money, just blend your own shakes!  And maybe do some research on soy, apparently it's not good for you like I initially thought.",1
"I am originally from England so I am always looking for that perfect cup of tea that reminds me of home, well, this is it! Cup after cup, perfect. Milk in the cup first, hit the brew button, and enjoy.",5
"Taste is a personal choice and I prefer light roast coffees. My favorite brand is Peets, but until Peets gets into the K-Cup market this will have to do. This brew is light and not bitter, however I do detect a slight, stale flavor. However this stale flavor is common in nearly all ground coffee, including the tail end of a bag of my beloved Peets coffee. I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk. This has happened when I run out of milk (cow, soy or almond) and I just don't feel like using aspartame (Nutrasweet).",5
"This tea had a weird strong musty smell and taste that got in my nose and would not go away until the next day. I'm not kidding. Don't know what's wrong with it but ended up throwing it out, and that was several bags. Teas Etc. is a good vendor so I was really surprised. Bleh.",1
"First, I'm not an ""organic"" food expert.  Far from it, in fact.  But recently, I decided to try out some healthier food choices, and that is how I came across Annie's Homegrown Berry Patch Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks.  There's been one thing driving my recent food purchases, and that's something my ""Principles of Nutrition"" professor in college said: ""always eat food as close to its source as possible"".  Where possible, it's preferential to eat food that was grown / raised geographically close to you.  Also, eating food ""close to its source"" means eating food in a form close to how it is found in nature (i.e., not overly processed).<br /><br />While I hold no illusions that these Fruit Snacks are in any way a ""health food"", I think compared to their competition, they are way ahead, both in quality of ingredients, and in taste.  The ""berry"" description of the taste is accurate, in my opinion.  I find that they have a great balance of fruit-tartness, along with the perfect amount of sweetness.  They are certainly not overly sweet like many snacks.  The texture of these snacks seems a bit ""stickier"" than some of the more mainstream competitors, and perhaps less ""gummy"".  I don't find this offensive, and have grown to prefer it, really.<br /><br />As for the cost - yes, these are expensive.  When you first see the relatively small individual serving bag, you might think you got ripped off.  But these Fruit Snacks are extremely satiating, and even though you may have only eaten a relatively small amount, you end up satisfied, and full.<br /><br />Given the cost, you might not be able to justify eating these every day, but I'd have no problem recommending these as a treat to have a few times a week.  Great taste, a seemingly decent set of ingredients, and a decent increase in quality vs. the competition.",5
"Bought these because the SAMs club here stopped carrying them and Walmart didn't have any good rawhide chews. The SAMs club ones were really good, so I am glad I found these to replace them. My dog is a chewer and they last about 4 days for her.",5
"I bought a few boxes of these and loved them,but be careful they do make you have gas so i was a full of gas while i ate them,<br />I probably ate too much as they are good tasting.",5
"We used to eat these a lot, and I think they are delicious.  Sorry to be unfair, but I wanted to say that these things are LOADED with sugar- just look at the nutrition info: 25 grams of sugar per serving, 1/4 cup- which you could easily eat twice that much. One serving has almost as much sugar as a candy bar (usually around 30 grams), and as much sugar as an 8 oz serving of coca cola.  Imagine if you eat a double serving- that's like downing a whole bottle of mountain dew or noshing on a king-size snickers!<br />I do think cherries are great for you, they have lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and a small amount of fiber. no sulfites which is good. They are better than candy, I suppose, but sweetened so much, this isn't the healthiest snack.  Just seems like everyone is raving about how healthy these are.  I used to think that, too, but then I actually faced the music.<br /><br />craisins are the same way, actually even worse.<br /><br />So while it's better than some chemical laden, corn syrup sweetened concoction from a gas station, these are a far cry from healthy.<br /><br />why can't i find unsweetened or lightly sweetened cherries at a decent price??",2
"I bought this for a dachshund/lab mix. He would only chew it IF I was trying to take it several time. The flavor just wasn't there for him to be interested. So I boiled some chicken broth and waited for it to cool a smidgen and let the nylabone sit in it for 15 minutes. I let it cool completely and now he's happy chewing! I have been watching him closely to make sure he doesn't eat plastic but he's doing great chewing. If you can't get your dog to enjoy it, I suggest trying that.",3
"I'm new to edamame and was hesitant about ordering 12 packs, but this vegetable is good. I was looking for a way to increase my protein and fiber content, while keeping my carbs low. I found it in this great tasting (tastes a bit like sunflower seeds) product. It provides 14g protein, 8g dietary fiber, and 4g fat per serving. This is just what I needed for my nutrition plan...I get vegetable servings and the protein I need throughout the day. I have added this to the subscription plan and will continue to purchase.",5
Every day is Thanksgiving at Sophie and Sam's dinner mat when they receive their Whiskas Turkey and Giblets in gravy.

"I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.",5
"I am a fan of thinkThin bars.  However, this shipment was dry and crumbly.  I was disappointed in my purchase and will continue to purchase thinkThin, just different flavors than dark chocolate.  Could have gotten an older or bad box.  Check your expiration dates on these.",2

I'm almost done with the bag and won't buy it again.<br /><br />My rice doesn't soak up enough water.  It's hard in the middle and slimy on the outside.  I bought similar rice at the local grocery store and have had perfect results with it almost every time.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews makes me think it's something I'm doing wrong, but I have tried every combo of preparing that I can think of.",1
I am an admitted Starbucks addict. I spend $60 plus a month on coffee shop coffee. I am amazed at how good this tastes!!!! I am seriously considering only buying the via from now on. I have wanted to cut down my coffee bill and this makes it all possible. I have added Torani's white chocolate mocha sauce to this but only a tablespoon. It is perfectly sweet for me with this addition.  This may have been the best thing Starbucks has ever done in my opinion. Love it!,5
"No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free ""cold pack"".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.",4
"These do taste great, however, what is with the price. If you buy in bulk it should cost less than what it does in the store and in my area this is cheaper at the store then through amazon",5

"Healthy Choice used to be a byword for mediocre diet food. During the last few years, however, they've gotten better and better, producing tasty grub at reasonable prices and with some real health advantages over things like, say, Banquet TV dinners.<br /><br />This latest product, a tasty Ziti with meat sauce, is a little different from some of their others. First, it doesn't need freezing. Second, you cook the pasta by dumping in water, nuking it and then straining it through the nifty little strainer lid! This makes it ideal for a compact lunch you can take to work. All you need is some water and a microwave and happiness will ensue!<br /><br />As far as the taste goes? I was surprised! The pasta came out nice and tender and there was a good mix of flavors in the meat suace as well as some chunks of what I really hope were actually meat. Even better, someone who likes to eat large, I'll tell you this actually left me nice and full and not feeling like I needed to eat anything else right away.<br /><br />Very good product. Highly recommended!",5
I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.,4

I have been feeding my German Shepherd Orijen since he was a pup (started on the LBP forumla). I love this food. He doesn't have to eat as much to maintain his weight...meaning less poop! His poop doesn't smell that bad and it is firm and good color. He LOVES this food too. Has a healthy coat and plenty of energy. No sign of anything lacking in his diet and no worries from me that it isn't safe to feed him. If you can't feed raw this is the next best thing.,5
"I stumbled across these while perusing Amazon's grocery section. They sounded very interesting, but despite the rave reviews I wasn't ready to commit to 12 bags. Then, lo and behold, there they were at the grocery store! I picked up 1 bag to try...and now it's over, I'm completely hooked. These things really are that delicious. Since they seemed to be a one-time thing at my local grocery, I'm now ordering them from Amazon. They're a great replacement for chips anytime you're craving something salty.",5

"I've been buying ZICO with mango in 11.2 oz. tetra-paks almost since they started offering them here on Amazon.  However, just as another reviewer explained, the most recent batch I received was horrible, it went from being the best coconut water to the worst I've ever had.  The packaging was slightly different and most alarming, the individual box no longer says anything about being from Brazil.  If this continues I will never buy this product again.  If you are having the same experience, please speak up on here so maybe we can get this fixed......",1
"Abbott is currently on backorder with this formula and stated that whatever is left in stores and floating around is all that's available. I am very happy to be able to purchase it through this vendor on Amazon as it is the only formula my daughter can tolerate for her severe spit up and reflux issues. We have tried everything, Similac Advanced, Similac Sensitive Isomil Soy, Nutramigen which is hypoallergenic, none of them helped us...This formula is currently the only pre-thickened rice starch formula available that is lactose free, which is helpful for us because our daughter is also sensitive to milk proteins. I hope I can find this formula back on shelves in stores soon!",5
"Lavazza coffee is great - no problem with that, but these pods are an absolute waste of $. I thought the pods would offer some convenience when in a rush to make espresso in the morning when heading out to work. Wrong move. They work poorly - I tried them in three different high quality machines, all with the same results. Poor, uneven flow with not enough substance to give a smooth shot with good creme. Frustrated, I decided to just open up the pods and put the good stuff in a can for proper use... that's when I discovered just how big a rip-off these are. Buying Lavazza in the can is about $7.00 for an 8.8 oz. can on average - I bought 150 pods for about $55 and when I emptied out about half of these into a can I got just that - 1 can. $27.50 per can. Hmmm... that means I just paid $20+ for their packaging. Stupid me. Convenience be damned, I'll just buy canned coffee and work for my cup in the morning.",1
"I don't love all nuts, and I don't love all macadamia nuts. But I do love these nuts. Just the right amount of saltiness and crunchiness. Yum! Pretty much tied with Emerald's dry roasted walnuts for my favorite snack.",5
"This chamomile tee is of average quality, but the most annoying part about it is that the expiration date on it was a month away from when it came.  I think that's a little fast to go through a 24-pack of chamomile tea, when you have a variety of K-cups at your disposal.",3
"This is an excellent soy sauce, the taste is light and sparkling and it won't overwhelm your meat or vegetable taste. I discover it in ""Asian food to go"" with small condiment packages and it satisfies everytime. No, it won't bring your food to new dimension, it enhances the taste of your main ingredient whatever it is - meat, poultry or seafood if you prefer it to salt.<br /><br />Regarding expiration date - soy sauce or fish sauce can last for years if full and unopened in a bottle, if it comes in a big bottle, pour them in smaller glass bottles to the rim with air tight lids, put in dark place and use one at a time to prevent oxidation that spoils and alters the taste. Air and temp spoil foods<br /><br />I have tried different brand of soy sauces, this is the most satisfied soy sauce available in USA",5
"This is a good price, but I think you can get it for about .11 an oz at Sam's Club. Great cereal though!",5
"I did an experiment with Peak Powdered Whole Milk and Willpowder. We bought both, used both. Peak came out ahead on all counts. The Willpowder is good but another reviewer (Sophronia ""Euphemia"" in San Diego) hit the nail on the head: it tastes like evaporated milk and doesn't dissolve well - there's a consistency that is off-putting, for lack of a better word. (I still want to try the Nido product but it seems expensive) Keep in mind if you're on a low-carb diet, Willpowder is CREAM with zero carbs and Peak is powdered WHOLE MILK with carbs. You could also use the Peak to make so-called Hood milk and lower the carbs: Homemade Low-Carb Milk: One cup:<br /><br />1-2 Tbs. of heavy cream (depending on how creamy you want it)<br />1 1/3 Tbs. of instant dry milk<br />1 cup of cold water<br />sprinkle of salt<br />tiny sprinkle of Splenda (if you want)<br /><br />Just put the ingredients in and shake it up. Refrigerate.<br /><br />Calories 65 if 1 Tbs. of cream is used, 110 if 2 Tbs. of cream is used<br />5 grams of fat / 10 grams of fat<br />3 carbs / 3 carbs<br />2 grams of protein / 2 grams of protein<br /><br />*ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT THAT MAY WORK FOR YOU: NESTLE MEDIA CREMA IN THE CAN.

"Won't eat 'em! Hence the three stars as I wanted to keep it neutral. As always your mileage may vary. Some cats probably really like these things.<br /><br />She's not totally wild about Cosequin either, even though I think that's probably the best formula for kitty arthritis. If you your cat is fussy but they like stuff like Laxatone, give them Feline Joint Gel. She practically does a happy dance when I get the tube out. And I can really see a difference in her ability to jump up on furniture when I give her the glucosamine supplements. Just not this one.",3
"What looks like a great deal is actually a terrible one. This is ONE box of 5 packs of granola bars (packed like Nature Valley). So, instead of receiving 20 snacks, you get 5.",1
"We are into our third box and both my companion and I really like it.  It is very easy to mix into the blender (which takes out almost all the lumps). I then put the contents into a two-quart plastic bottle (due to the foam, a one quart is too small) give it a good shake and stick it into the fridge - wait an hour or so to get cold and it is all set. Great in coffee, on cereal or even straight into a glass. It reminds me of the milk that we drank at my uncle's dairy farm in Michigan.<br /><br />If you always buy milk in gallon sizes at the supermarket, then this product will not save you much money (especially if the milk is the store brand and/or on sale) however, for people like us it saves running to the (expensive) convenience store late at night to purchase milk (costing 2-3 times as much).",5
"Bought a case of these for my dogs (yeah, I know, I'm one of those people!) and the quality was great!  No added sodium too!  Perfect! Will definitely buy again.",5
My little 5 pound Maltese loves these! I mix half or one third of one tray with his dry food and he just gobbles it up! These are way more expensive in any store.,5
so good my dog has had a lot of problems and theis has here keep her around for a while longer. thank you cesar!,5
"I was skeptical when I read the other reviews saying that this Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream coffee tasted like a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato but I was very pleasantly surprised! I tried it with just milk, milk & vanilla creamer, and just vanilla creamer.<br />The milk & creamer (big splashes of each) yielded the best faux caramel macchiato flavor. Obviously it's more of a cafe au lait than a latte, but for under $1, I am very satisfied with this cuppa joe.<br />I prefer this flavor over the green mountain Hazelnut flavored coffee.<br /><br />I tried 4 and 10 ounce sizes and was pleased with the strength and flavor of both sizes, with the smaller size being a bit darker.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, this is a definite YES.",5

"the product in the picture is not the Katz-N-Flocken, but the Indigo Moon which is the grain free product.  So don't just go with the picture.  I tried to contact the seller twice, but received no response.  I'm actually on the phone now with Amazon to resolve the issue.<br />I can't attest to the Katz-N-Flocken because I didn't feed it to my cats.  It contains a lot of ""junk"", like rice, and barley, which are known to cause food allergies amongst cats, as well as ""meal"" type of stuff, which is just ground up junk.  If you can afford it, please feed your cat whole meat, and not ""meal"".  That's why I am upset they send me this junk instead of the Indigo Moon.",1
All of us love these Sweet Stripes peppermints.  They do not have a strong peppermint flavor and are really sweet - so they are perfect if you want just a little something.  They are soft - not hard candy - so you usually end up chewing them.  If you crave something sweet now and then this works great for not so many calories/carbs.,5
These are really good!  They are soft and have just the right amount of sweetness.,5

She sent me a photo of my nieces and nephews enjoying the treats.<br /><br />It's a little pricier than some of the other gift baskets on Amazon, but it's worth it. Unlike some of the other gifts, this one really does look like the picture, so you know what you are getting.",5
"My wife heard about this ramen a couple weeks ago, and we picked up a box based upon the rave reviews in Korea.  It's ok - not great, not bad - but certainly not worth the premium over Nong Shim's Neogori or Kimchi Ramens.<br /><br />Taste:<br />no strong chicken taste, no strong spicy smell.  The ramen is spicy, but more like a jalepeno spicy instead of a kimchi ramen spicy.  The difference is in the...sharpness...if that makes any sense.  Other ramens have a low and nice hot burn, this one has a quick hot burn.<br /><br />Noodles are ok - nothing particularily special.<br /><br />Basically, I think people wanted a ramen where you don't smell too much after you eat it.  This delivers.  You can easily eat this, have a beer, and noone would probably notice - no dragon breath.  If that's what you're looking for, then this will fit the bill.  No exceptional taste, but nothing which will repulse people if you go to a public place later.<br /><br />Would I order this again?  Probably not.  Personally, if I want ramen, I want something with powerful flavor, because I'm not going anywhere after I eat it.",3
I've always wanted to incorporate green tea into my diet and was thrilled when I stumbled upon matcha green tea.  I turn it into a latte using Very Vanilla Soy Milk and it makes the perfect treat.,5
My dog loves these things.  Great as a training aid or just for rewarding your pet.  My chihuahua mix loves these and they're not too large for her mouth even though she's only 13 pounds.,5
"These are excellent chocolates, but at $54/lb (plus another $6 shipping), there's better (I like De Neuville, Maison du Chocolat, and Recchiuti, for example, and there are others). Also, Neuhaus chocolates are almost all pralin&eacute;, which, if you like it, is excellent, but I usually prefer a little more variety in a one-pound assortment.",4
"Seeing a Jamaican coffee label, I assumed this would be a STRONG brew.  In actuality, it is a relatively weak brew.  It has a very nice aroma, and the flavor is well-suited to those who like cream and sugar in coffee (in other words, not bitter).  Aside from the flavor, the package is fantastic!  One pad into the coffee maker, dump the pad into the trash, and viola, cleanup almost complete.  So much easier than filter and grounds.  Less mess, more stars!",5
"Generally, when tasting zero-calorie diet products, I advise people to first recognize that its a diet product and won't taste as good as its full-calorie counterpart.<br /><br />Forget about that in this instance.  This pancake syrup tastes every bit as good as any other pancake syrup (sugar free or not) I've ever had.  Sure, its a tiny bit thinner than Aunt Jemima, but its not water!  And the flavor is spot on!<br /><br />Does it taste like pure maple syrup? Probably not.  Does it taste like every other imitation maple syrup out there? I think so.<br /><br />Seriously, if this can taste this good with negligible calories, why ever use the other stuff?<br /><br />This is great. Try it. Seriously.  You won't regret it.  And, if you do, Walden Farms will refund your money if you saved your receipt.  Risk free deliciousness!",5
"Let me  begin by saying, I am not particularly adventurous in the candy aisle. I don't pick sweets up to try on a whim, because, let's face it - whether or not I like it, it's probably been sitting either in a box or on a shelf since the Stone Age. But when my roommate bought some at the 99 Cent Store (yes, we poor people do shop there) and offered me one, I took a bite to be polite, and ended up eating the entire thing and a second one to boot.<br /><br />These sesame bars are crunchy, sweet, and full of delicious sesame flavor. As someone who likes to catch and eat all the runaway toasted sesame seeds from her bagel, I could not get enough of these. The next time I passed the store, I ran in and used pocket change to buy six more, and have been stashing them like a squirrel.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed at the cost of this product (really? a pack of 36 is $27?) but maybe I'm just being silly and am disappointed I can't stock more for my twice weekly indulgence without going all the way to the store. Phooey.",5
took a little too long to arrive.  cereal is broken up bad within the box.  this cereal is usually pretty chuncky in the box from a grocery store.,3
"I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.<br /><br />Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.",1
This product was awful. I will never buy it again.  It was grainy and had a terrible after taste.,1
"As I said not my idea of Gourmet!  I have had much better, that was not advertised as gourmet hot chocolate.  I had one, no I had two cups and then gave the rest to my neighbor.  I then went and bought Swiss hot coco from the grocery store.",2
I love a good dark roast coffee and Baronet delivers with their French Roasted Dark Kenya Pods.,5
"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",3
"I bought this not even 3 weeks ago from Pepper Palace for around $10.  Although it seemed like a good idea at the time...it's a waste.  Within 1 week, 2 sprouts came up and everything seemed okay.  I took care of them and everything...Now...they're both dead.  You're better off purchasing seeds from an independent grower for WAY less than what this thing is worth, or purchase the peppers themselves, take out the seeds and store them in your freezer in a plastic bag until planting season.",1
"To call a seed a plant is like calling an egg a chicken.  This is an overpriced single seed in a drink can. I hope it grows, but based on the reviews (...which I wish I had read before purchasing) the chance of this ""plant"" producing peppers is not so hot. (pun intended). Now I wish I had the drink in the can instead.  That would have been more useful.",1
"My first impression is not the initial taste on the tip of my tongue as first expected, but the powerful, almost peppery taste at the back of my throat as I sip this one down. On the second sipping, more on the tip of my tongue this time, the tea's more subtle qualities come through: the mellow side of the lemon and ginger combination--then wham again with the peppery snap at the back of my throat. This is no mildly flavored herbal, but one directly infused with ginger root, lemon peel, lemon grass and blackberry leaves. One other interesting ingredient is linden, a plant with many medicinal properties and used for such for many centuries. It would be interesting to know if it is the linden flower that is used (and most probably it was), since this is a diaphoretic, a very mild fever-inducing part of the plant when taken as a hot tea. This naturally enables the body to help fight off infections according to some sources I looked up on the web. Not to worry though--this is not a fever that will keep you from work! It's one that will make your body work for you instead.<br /><br />I bought this one for some relief from a sore throat and it definitely helps ease my sinus induced problem. As with any lemon-flavored beverage I've tried, it does leave a slight aftertaste of lemon, but not too strong or unpleasant. I imagine it would be quite good with honey, which I will definitely try once I get home from work. For now, a slight bit of sugar seemed to compliment the flavors nicely, even bringing them out more. This is a strong flavored herbal, not a mellow one as I've come to expect a lot of herbals to be. Drink with caution if you like your herbals on the softer side. This one's courting the wilder side of the tea experience.",4
Had read about Nora products in a magazine and decide to try..not disappointed.  The brownies are delicious.  Will buy again.,5
"I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!",3
I tried this food for several months but it made my cats throw up. They lost weight so switched back to Kirkland brand.,2
Am a real fan of this type of cookie and they are so hard to find.  This was our 1st time to buy this brand but they were a real disappointment. They were too dry.  Make me wonder how long they may have been in inventory.  Will not buy again.,2
"Let me begin by stating that this is a great value, like them or not. I have begun to appreciate their taste, but cannot deny that flavored (salted) are more tasty. The good thing about these is that they have no salt (which is good for me because I would probably have a heart attack because I consume so many). You can add salt to them if you wish, but you don't have to add the insane amount in salted seeds. Thanks for the good value and great option.",5
"Justins almond butter is a really tasty product! You might want to buy the value pack, because once you start snacking on this, it will go extremely fast",5
"The seaweed is excellent quality however you only get to make one piece at a time because the Nori is very small. It's awful if you're making a lot of sushi at once. I prefer larger sheets so I can roll and cut many pieces of sushi. I will not be buying this product again because of this. It was however delicious Nori and good quality rice and very quick to do. It's just no good if you're looking to make more then 10 pieces, plus that causes it to actually take more time then it should.",1
"Our old Aussie Lab has gotten a whole new life since starting on these... It takes a while to start being effective, possibly a month, but used regularly our dogs stiffness and joint problems have lessened. He is back to his old self. Downside, it is costly but worth it.<br />Used along side Metacam, we are seeing great results ( obviously get vets advice on this...",5
Well I'm disgusted with Orville Redenbacker for canceling the pour over cheddar popcorn as with all the other reviewers maybe the pour on's were to expensive and people wanted more for there money so they bought the regular instead. I have seen in Sam's wholesale were you can buy liquid butter if you want to pour on your popcorn for better taste because after you eat one of the pour overs you just cant go back to the cheaper styles. I wonder why they don't do the same for cheese? If any body knows were I can find it let me know!,2
"Looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won't go straight to your waistline? These paper thin - beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any/all of your favorite toppings. Hummus, cheese (hard and spreadable), vegetable wafers (cucumbers, zucchini, roasted peppers etc), chip dips, salsa... I could go on forever. At 120 calories for 19 crackers (0 calories from fat) these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you'll feel great about eating them. I initially found these in a ""Health Food Store"" but Amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money. Quality was as good or better. Well... that's what I think. Oh, and YUM!",5
"My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all. So I bought it, but I was a bit skeptical. I was amazed by the positive effects on my voice. And now Throat coat tea is one of the most important working tools.",5
"It may not be fair for me to review this.  I sent it out to Uncle Johnny just yesterday.  But when I think about it, that box of dried fruit and nuts can't be all that big, and certainly not worth $70.  But somehow that's what my total came out to by the time I was at the end.  I think it was the shipping that did it.  I love my uncle Johnny, but that really hurt.  I found something that looked nice and was in my price range and then once I click ""submit"" I got a total of $69.+!!!  I was LIVID!  And I can't help but muttering to myself over and over now- if I'm going to give out $70 to someone as a gift, I certainly want them to get $70 worth of something.  So, I guess in the long run, it's not the product I'm reviewing, it's the shipping scam.<br />And these businesses who started with a wonderful idea, have turned our sympathies to just that- A SCAM.  I can not longer support them.  I'm out.  There are other ways I can say I love you, or I'm sorry your wife died.",2
"Haven't seen these in stores since I can remember.  Delighted to find them at Amazon.  They're an old 50's favorite, and haven't changed - kudos to Planters.  Very nice mix of peanuts, sugar and salt in a very crunchy traditional bar.",5

"I have two dogs who LOVE this stuff!  It is a healthy, low calorie treat that smells great.  My babies can get as many treats as they deserve:-)",5
"This is bad tuna, can't say it any better. It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make. The chunk light they make is slightly better. 1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style. I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can. When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time. DON'T BUY.",1
"Don't order this product if you think you're getting two bottles.  Only one bottle arrived and I'm having a wonderful time trying to get my refund.  Fool me once, shame on you.",1
"I have had a long affair with Molina Vanilla.  Six years ago, while in Los Algodones, I bought a large bottle.  I finally finished the bottle and ordered another but the new one was ""the blend by Molina Vainillin.""  It does not seem as strong as the one without the ""Vanillin."" It is still a excellent product for the price.",4
Buyer beware.  I am very disappointed in this product.  This size is very small and the quality appears average.  It is definitely not worth the money.,1
"I have another hair balm and was able to compare the ingredients, they are very similar to another product made for white hair, specifically split ends. If you have split ends, this will seal in the ends and keep them from drying and splitting more. Just be sure to use so very little. Rub your hands together and smooth through the ends of your hair. I really like this but the instructions are poor, even for black hair.",4
"Twizzlers' Black Licorice Bites are delicious but difficult to find in the Northeast.  Fortunately, Amazon carries them!  My father loves these licorice bites (or ""nibs"" as they are sometimes called), and he was thrilled to receive them as part of his Father's Day gift.  It comes as an 8-pack, so they should last a little while.  Thanks, Amazon!",5
"I purchased these as an alternative to the duck jerky (made in China) that I no longer wanted to feed to my small/medium dogs.  Since one is allergic to chicken my choices are limited.  These arrived today and my 3 dogs sniffed them suspiciously.  I broke them in half for them and they decided to give them a try.  They seemed to like them...they are different then I thought they would be.  They are almost the texture of a soft granola bar and not like jerky at all.  They are about 2"" by .5"" and the  contents of the bag were not crumbly like some have described.  All in all, I think these will work to replace the  jerky and since they are made and packaged in the US, I feel better about giving them treats.... Oh, and the  cost is pretty good too...",4
"This tastes like any other powdery grated cheese for topping Italian food and such.  I was so disappointed that the photo and the description do not match, as I expected to get what I saw and didn't notice the difference between the label and the title.  Shame on me for not noticing the conflict of info before I ordered.  The product is average in taste and texture for what it is, 3 stars.  Amazon customer service was great regarding a refund, 5 stars for them, but the photo is still wrong so be wise to the discrepancy.<br /><br />UPDATE: PHOTO HAS BEEN UPDATED AND IS CORRECT",3
"I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs.  He loves it and, in my view, it is a very healthy dog formula. I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein.  My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select. I rate this product 5 stars.",5
"I've always liked the oats n' honey bars and was in the habit of eating them at work - for 90 cents from the vending machine. Thankfully I realized that Amazon must sell them for cheaper, and I was right.

"This Wild Planet salmon gives me a lot of energy. It feels like the salmon is beefed up with something they feed it. I tried store bought wild salmon and ate as much as 6 ounces, but I did not get the severe energy spike this Wild Planet salmon gave me. For example, at 10pm I ate a whole can and had so much energy I could not fall asleep. EVen when I did fall asleep, I slept litely.",3
"Wonderful, my favorite of the K cups.  Will order frequently.  I can honestly recommend this to those chocolate lovers who also like a touch of coffee.",5
There is no coffee in this K-cup. How do I know? The cup is completely empty when the Krueg is done with it. No grinds at all.  That doesn't bother me as much as the fact that it has very little coffee flavor.  That being said...I do enjoy the taste and it is rather good for instant Hot Chocolate.,3
"I used this as a pasta sauce and it was pretty good.  I would not buy it regularly because it is a bit pricey, but it made a quick and easy birthday lunch for my little (45 year old) brother.  He liked it a lot.",4
"I was really excited to get these because I've seen babies sucking on these pouches around town.  Now that my baby's eating solids, I wanted to see what all the rage is.  I love them for many reasons!<br /><br />-First, they're ORGANIC,  no fillers added.<br /><br />-Second, they TASTE GOOD (of course I tasted!). What's more is my baby loves it more than any food he's tried so far.  He couldn't get enough.<br /><br />-NUTRITIOUS:  Baby gets his greens--broccoli and spinach--mixed with sweet pears.  You can actually see the green flecks of goodness.<br /><br />-TEXTURE:  Fruits and veggies are well-pureed, perfect for stage 1.<br /><br />-3 WAYS TO FEED: 1-Squeeze into bowl and spoon feed, 2-Squeeze directly onto spoon, 3-Squeeze into baby's mouth or let baby suck it out through plastic tube.<br />For the first serving, I mostly spoon fed my baby, but once I let him suck on it, he wanted to keep sucking it down.<br /><br />-QUANTITY: There's a lot of food in there!  2 servings per pouch, 4.5 oz pouches<br /><br />-CONVENIENT:  Of course it's convenient because you can feed your baby nutritious, organic food without dirtying even one dish or utensil.  Convenient because you can feed on the go.  Convenient because the cap twists back on so you can save the rest for later...<br /><br />-The one DRAWBACK would have to be the PRICE.  These are pretty expensive for a pouch of food.  But it is organic, and for now, I expect to pay more for that.<br /><br />I'm sold on these, but because of the price, for me, these will be a ""sometimes"" food bought for convenience and travel.  In fact I plan on taking these on vacation with me so I can feed my baby in his stroller, on the run. I'm actually excited to give it a try!<br /><br />And by the way, after I'm done here, I'll be searching to see what other varieties Baby Gourmet offers...<br /><br />Happy feeding!",5
I purchased this tea at a mall after sampling several flavors I instantly was hooked. Although they are a little pricey a little goes a long way. I now buy them on Amazon at a fraction of the cost. And after several weeks of drinking these teas my skin has taken on a glow. I have had people tell me that I look so healthy and I am sure it has to do with the antioxidants and the other ingredients. I purchased soothing nighttime teas and they work great. I highly recommend Teavana and all their  products. One very happy customer!,5
"It doesn't taste great, but it doesn't taste horribly bad either. You can get used to it (but there's no substitute yet for the taste of regular sugar). If you want to lose weight and feel cutting out sugar is key to your strategy, this seems to be the best option so far.",4
"My baby has serious allergies, and it's difficult to find microwaveable foods she can eat. We took a container to her allergy doctor and she okayed them for us. Tonight we tried them and lo and behold, she loved them. She ate the whole bowl, a first in her recent history. It's a pity that Gerber makes most of her products with carrots and sweet potatoes. We would have a greater choice if they didn't. However, we are willing to try more new foods in the near future. By the way, we microwaved the bowl but it did not become too runny like other reviewers said. It was the perfect texture and softness. I would even say it tasted better than Kraft's version. We all are very satisfied!",5
Santa Fe Refried Beans are delicious.  They taste like you have spent all day making homemade beans.  They are not easy to find and should be as the flavor and consistency make them a must for pantry shelves.  Easy to store and they take only five minutes to make.  Once you try them you will want more!,5
"Dagoba New Moon is a must have for chocoholics like me. The flavor is rich with subtle overtones. Any higher cocoa content and the flavor loses its richness and is overwhelmed with bitterness. I recommend heating a half bar in the microwave until it slightly melts, then having fun scooping the melted chocolate into your mouth with a spoon to savor the magnificent flavor.",5
A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.,4
"The Edamame soy nut has a taste & texture similar to a regular peanut.  The soy nut has less fat and more protein.<br /><br />The wasabi flavoring adds a hot kick.  It's not the same type of heat as a pepper.  A pepper's heat is oil based, and longer lasting.  The wasabi heat is volatile heat that travels up the sinuses.  It's an intense heat that clears the sinuses, but it is short duration and does not linger.<br /><br />I would have given this product 5 stars, but the wasabi flavoring isn't consistently applied over the soynuts.  This won't stop me from buying more.",4
"I live in the UK and ordered these flowers for my aunt in Florida.  She was exceptionally pleased with them, and says they are one of the nicest bouquets she has ever received.",5
"I was looking forward to giving this item as a gift.  When I received the box it had been crunched a bit.  When I opened it, the box of tea was also crushed.  Nothing to affect the quality of the tea but the appearance meant I could not give it as a gift.  Disappointed with shipping.  Should have had some airbags in it or something.  Hope I enjoy the tea!",3
"This tea product got me running alright, to the crapper. But it did help loose about 10 lbs, mostly compacted fecal matter. I also feel more energized and feeling alot better. Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided, however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper. Great product great buy!",4
"We can no longer find this cereal in our stores, so you have been sending us 6 boxes at a time. On the last delivery, the plastic holding the 6 boxes together<br />was so tight that it damaged the bottoms of the boxes. There is no way to make<br />the boxes stand upright. The cereal is not affected. I just wanted you to be<br />aware of the packing flaw.",5
"I had some delicious pumpkin cereal that I bought at a gourmet market last fall. Since it was a seasonal item, they no longer have it. Hoping this was similar, I took a chance. It is not pumpkin-y at all. I guess the ""pumpkin"" comes from adding pumpkin seeds to tasteless raisin bran. This cereal also has a lot of calories, about 220 per serving. That's pretty high compared to tasteless raisin bran. Now I have 6 boxes of this stuff. What to do?",3
i am really addicted to this soup very good pick me up i have a problem with my microwave because soup pops up and turns over in micro i guess i have too high wattage still a little pricy on line,5
"I use this BBQ sauce on everything! Burgers, fries, you name it! I got it for a great price from Amazon as well, which combined with free shipping makes it an absolute no-brainer.",5
"Tried this by accident.  I wanted a red zinfandel with my margherita pizza and this one caught my eye as I love old vine wines.  It's a zinfandel based blend that is serious yet not overpowering, with a very slightly sweet finish.  My wife, who doesn't drink very dry wines loved it and had me buy a bottle at the restaurant's market.  Bottle cost $16",4
I bought this and the Torani sugar free brands in the past.  They both have a good taste when I use it in my Ice Coffee.  The DaVinci brand works just as good as the Torani brand which is probably more known.  I got a very good price for the DaVinci and love it is in plastic bottles.,5
"Coffee is very weak,I have to use 3 packs to make 4 cups of coffee.",1
I started my Golden Retriever on this food...slowly switching him to it from another brand.  He had the worst gas I have ever smelled in my entire life.  You couldn't even be in the same room with him.  Need less to say he is not eating it anymore.,1
"This is the best cocoa out there.  It makes the best hot cocoa even if you don't use milk.<br /><br />Just Droste, water, and touch of sugar.  It's corn-free too.",5
This is a great morning tea it has no crash and keeps me going through the entire day.  I do love to drink coffee although this doesn't have the coffee taste it does have the kick I would strongly recomend this!,5
"I bought this item as subscribe and save for $ 19.75 last month, now it is $ 45.63, almost tripled price.  Does amazon surposely help us to get better deals and save money?",2
"I didn't know what to expect when I received this bottle of water from amazon. Our tap water tastes terrible, so we always drink the generic store-bought bottled water which is a cut above tap.<br /><br />Well, ESSENTIA bottled water is gorgeous.  To me it tastes like what fresh water from a spring would probably taste like.  It is so fresh tasting with absolutely no after-taste.  I don't know how they do it!  The label reads purified water with electolytes, so obviously this is not spring water, but it is a superior bottled water that I would highly recommend.  I'll definitely get this again.  A clean, fresh, wonderful tasting water.",5
"At the end of the day, it's just water.<br /><br />The label claims a lot of things such as a silky smooth taste, better hydration, the infusion of electrolytes, and the ""best available pH at 9.5"" which I really can't comment on as I didn't have any scientific equipment to test the pH level.<br /><br />I wish I could give you some flowery comments like you can with wine, such as having the ability to smell a hint of apricots, smoke, and charcoal while drinking this, but I can't.  I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a ""wow"" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a ""Water Challenge"" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the ""better"" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.",3
"This is a really great, quality vanilla. I've used it exclusively in my baking for a couple of years now. I'm surprised by the price though! I buy this exact bottle at a local ""gourmet"" market that usually overprices everything and it's $8, not $20. Yikes.",5
Not horrible but did not care for the taste of this chocolate personally. Ate one and gave the rest to my son and his family.,2
"I just purchased a container of 25 for $9.99 at TJ Maxx.  Poodles build a lot of tartar on their teeth so I thought this would be a great way to help their hygiene.  Seeing the cost online for just a few ""stix""... I'm happy to see that I got a great deal.  Possibly I'll go back today to purchase a few more containers of them.  My two dogs<br />absolutely go nuts over these.  For a toy poodle, one ""stix"" seems large... so I break them in half.  However, they would devour a whole one in no time if I let them have it.  The ingredients look healthy.... starting with Rice flour, protein concentrate, vegetable glycerin, water, etc....",5
"I got a variety pack for on-the-go snacks for the kids.  They get excited each time I pull a box out, eager to see what's inside.  I was happy with all of the boxes.  The kids didn't like the tuna, but I did! I am not sure why other reviewers did not like the tuna- I am quite finicky when it comes to food. Although the tuna salad is not like what you would make at home, it is what I expected out of a box.",4
Okay..so there are 24 in a box X 2 boxes...and that equals 25 servings?  Which then only equals 14 total ounces?<br />I can't buy this product without knowing exactly how much coffee I'm paying for.,1
Our 4 yr old is in LOVE with this gumball machine.  We really like that it requires money so he cant just get it whenever he wants it : ) It takes all coins too which is a plus,5
"Back in the early '60's my family would take several road trips a year from our home in NYC to the Boston area to visit my grandparents. We'd always stop at a Howard Johnsons restaurant where, in the days before ""kids meals"", I'd always order the traditional hot dogs, B&M boston baked beans and brown bread. You can't find B&M brown bread where I live in Va....it was just as I remembered...and it's a great price. Highly recommended (especially with dogs and beans)",5
"I was a bit hesitant to buy this tea due to the low price. But, the truth is that this is some very high quality tea at a bargain generic price.  We have spent 3 or 4 times as much for bags of less quality.  This tea has excellent flavor and aroma, perfect for a good, strong cup of tea.  I've also noticed that this tea brews much quicker than other brands.",5
"Now here's the thing, I'm a huge fan of imported Italian hard salami. As a sandwich meat, a pizza topping or appetizer, there's not much better as far as I'm concerned. Now domestic brands are a different story. My experience with them had been uniformly bad, until now. This Bridgford Hard Salami is excellent. Not just OK, but stands up well compared to any of the imported Italian meats I've tried. If you like salami, this stuff is the real thing.",5
"Outstanding taste. I haven't had another GF cookie that can compare. Yes the cookies have a great taste but all the cookies were smashed into crumbs upon arrival. Didn't do much for the event I was planning to serve them at, but I used the crumbs as a fun part of a cereal mix.",2
"I just received my order of Big Train Chai...and right after this review, I'll be walking both canisters to the neighborhood dump. This will teach me (again) not to purchase in bulk without trying a small sample first. I had chosen Big Train because of the wonderful reviews. So it was disappointing when I made my first cup and sipped a concoction that tasted like powdered milk with a dash of pumpkin seasoning. Very chalky...like cheap, instant cocoa mix. The blend of seasonings is more reminiscent of pumpkin pie than chai and has none of the peppery goodness that I enjoy so much. The one positive I will give is that it is a very fine grain and easily dissolves in hot water.",1
This K-cup variety pack is great for trying to find which iced tea you like best.  I enjoyed the raspberry the most. Great value and variety.,5
"This was a delicious but dangerous purchase.  I have been limiting myself to 1 bar a day but it's very hard to stick to my plan.  I love nuts, chocolate and coconut and Almond Joy has all 3 in a tasty combo.  Quite irresistible!!",5
"None of the stores in my area carry Karo Pancake Syrup - for some reason no one can explain to me, it has disappeared from the shelves in the last 5 years.  What a 'happy camper' I was when I found it through Amazon.  Best tasting pancake syrup I have found other than the pure maple tree kind.  Shipping was on time and items arrives well packed.  All in all a very good purchase experience.",5
"I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!",5
"My kids love chocolate milk, and we only drink organic.  The aseptic cartons are great for packing in lunch boxes.  With the discount for recurrent purchases, the Horizon 18-pack price was a bargain at first.  But more recently the price went up, and now I can get it cheaper at my local Sam's Club.",3
"I love Vita Coco, but the tropical fruit version is horrid. They couldn't pay me to take another case of it.",1
"I've tried a number of other brands of vegetable broth and broth mix, some much more expensive than Seitenbacher. This is by far the best for my family's taste. It's delicious!!! I not only use it as broth in my soups, but I'm using it as seasoning  by adding it to my rice when I add the tumeric or safron during the steaming phase. I'm sure I'll find more uses for it.<br /><br />The mix has 430 mg sodium per 1 tsp mix (or 1 cup of broth), and although I'd like a little less sodium, it's within my tolerance. It would be good if Seitenbacher made a reduced or no-salt version.",5
"This tastes like real chocolate milk!  I've tried Slim-Fast, Muscle Milk, and other protein shakes, but I can't stand anything that has sucralose, aspartame, or any other artificial sweetener - they leave a nasty after-taste.  Orgain doesn't have any of that artificial stuff and it tastes great.",5
We have not been disappointed with any flavor or these cookies.  They are the very best! Raspberry is my favorite:),5
"This yogurt ""starter"" seems to be good stuff. The price of the yogurt starter seems to be a bit high, bringing home-made yogurt to the same cost as store bought. But the home-made yogurt is better for you because the store-bought yogurt is Pastureized after making the yogurt, thus destroying the friendly bacteria culture. This system starts with Pastureized milk but nothing is allowed to harm the friendly bacteria in the home-prepared version of the yogurt. After preparation, I mix mine with a tad of Sugar Twin and vanilla, sometimes adding some diced strawberries, blueberries or peaches.",4
I brewed this with my automatic tea maker on the medium strong setting. The flavor is delightful. It is just perfect for white tea and the hint of jasmine adds a nice finishing note. Highly recommended for someone who likes white tea with a hint of flavor. Bonus this is organic and fair trade.,5
"This is the last food or other product meant to be ingested by humans or dogs I will buy from Amazon that does not list the complete ingredients in the product information. I was dismayed to open the package and find that the first ingredient listed is SUCROSE, the second DEXTROSE WITH MALTODEXTRIN! Only one of the other ingredients is a natural product, and there are two dyes included. This packet went straight into the garbage can, where it belonged! I only bought it because Amazon stopped selling DentaClean's Sugar Free Breath Mints for Dogs. BIG MISTAKE!",1
"These snacks are perfect for the on the go exercise enthusiast.  They don't taste too sugary and are a great pick me up for when I need to replenish on the food front.  For the price I paid, I'm very satisfied.",4
"Love the product with no corn, but my cat was not too thrilled with it.  However, not given a choice he finally came around and now eats it just fine.  Hunger outweighs finicky and I know he is much better off without the corn.  The products out there for cats without corn is minimal at best, so the effort at out waiting my cat to come around was well worth it.  It would be nice if there weren't as many veggies in it, but I'll take that over corn any day.",5
Warning if you're looking for PURPLE swirl lollipops...  these are BLUE.  Not sure what to do now with 2 dozen blue swirl lollipops for a purple themed party.,1
"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson. After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam. When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made. This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam...""<br /><br />This stuff is great! It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar. It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on. Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato. This will be a regular item in my house. I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.",5
"Dont fear the fannings, this is good tea. I've had friends comment on it and gone through several boxes without getting bored or feeling like I'm wasting my money. Give it a shot if you're looking for a good decaf blend. Do make sure to put in the extra bag for the pot (my reasonably large iron pot from Teavana takes three bags to make nice strong tea).",4
"Sweet 10 Suguar Substitute arrived in the shipping window time, I think even a little early.  No problems with the shipping.<br /><br />The product does the job of an artificial  liquid sweetener, but it is very expensive and not sold in grocery stores.  Being required to purchase 12 bottles with each purchase also adds to the expense.<br /><br />I am disappointed somewhat that the first bottle contained 6 oz as stated on the product, but the second bottle only contained 4 oz.  The remaining bottles are unused as of this date.  Do not know if they each contain 6 oz.",3
There was no exceptional taste difference to me between the dark and milk chocolate. Still the classic Reese's taste. It is an interesting change but a little bland for what I consider dark chocolate.,4
"Excellent delivery time.  We need to get grocery chains to lower price on this product, and the best way is competition.",5
"I tried the Chocolate one, and it is perfect. Tastes very natural and not excessively sweet like some other brands. I will definitely be buying more.",5
I did not expect this to taste very good.  I was surprised that it was great.  I will be ordering this item in the future. It also arrived very quickly.,5
"My Lab loves Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream. This grain-free salmon-based food is easy on her stomach, keeps her healthy and her coat shiny.",5
"I've been using Fleischmann's Bread Machine Yeast to make bread in a Panasonic bread machine for a number of years.  I recently purchased a package of Red Star Baking Yeast on Amazon, to try to save money.  I was very disappointed with the Red Star yeast and have just discarded it.<br />Using the Fleischmann's yeast, I need 1 1/4 teaspoon to make a perfect small loaf of bread in 1 hour and 55 minutes.  This amount of Red Star yeast produced a rather pathetic un-risen loaf, so I gradually increased the amount of Red Star yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Although I was able to get my bread to rise more by using this higher dose of Red Star yeast, the loaf had more of a square shape than a rounded shape, it had a coarse texture, and it tasted ""yeasty.""<br />I've gone back to using Fleischmann's Bread Machine yeast.  Although expensive at about $8 per 4-oz jar at the local supermarket, it seems to be worth the price.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO"">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2 Pounds (32 ounces - 908 g)</a>",1
The amount of nuts in the package is perfect for a snack as it is not too much and not too little.  The nuts are fresh and crunchy and the packages are very easy to open.  The best part if that the case amount if very good for the price as I usually buy one box of seven for around $4.00 and I bought the whole case of twelve boxes for a little over $33.  You can't beat the price and the product is very good.,5
Like kettle corn popcorn?  Don't like calories and fat?  This is the product for you.  I love it!,5
My dogs and I love this food. They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them. I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix.,5
"I am still experimenting with the best mix for me, but so far, the milk is too overwhelming for a person in me that likes his chocolate/cereal/etc. with his milk rather than the other way around.  In other words, I'm tasting too much of the milk and it's not a taste I care for.  It is better than the cheap stuff like store brand or Swiss, etc. but I would much rather use it in my espresso machine than boil off milk (will be one of my next experiments).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very good chocolate.  I have used the straight cooking based Ghiradelli cocoa and it is intense, but good actually in an espresso type situation.  I'm thinking this stuff should be a bit less intense than the cocoa made for cooking and be even better for my personal purpose with it.<br /><br />-Beats the store brand or use with water stuff if you either have the mix down or do not mind the extra milky taste.<br /><br />-Even though milk has to be used and milk does cost more than free water, the chocolate is not only worth it but cost to cost, the intensity level of Ghiradelli vs. Swiss or other is a lot higher.  In other words, while Swiss may be cheaper on paper, it will take a TON more to get to the same intensity level as Ghiradelli AND it will not taste as good.  So the having to buy milk is really the only additional cost factor going on here.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I have yet to figure out a good enough potion that makes the taste less milky.  If I cannot figure one out, I will have to downgrade this review for the product being of use for only specific people or applications.<br /><br />-Have to buy milk and with such a nice chocolate, I'd recommend an organic or nice albeit expensive milk.  I will update this review if I find that using water/espresso machine/etc. factors can take the a good bit of milk out of the equation.<br /><br />So there you have it.  More pros than cons from me, though I am only partially satisfied at this point.  Will update if I can figure out how to nail down better solutions to my liking, and if anything, I can always use it how I did with the Ghiradelli type made for cooking!  Afterall, I bought this hoping it would make good hot cocoa, but knowing it would be top quality chocolate that I could at least toss into my espresso mixes if it didn't work out.",3
"I don't know if there are any available elsewhere in the USA, but certainly where we live, there's nothing that's quite like a malted milk cookie (which is a shame, as they're delicious).  Moos are only one of several of these kinds of cookies from England, but they're a cute one, and the way that these are set into six little packages helps to keep them fresh!  If you like the taste of malt, these are definitely worth a try.<br /><br />I'd add two comments, though.  Firstly, because these come from England (and because import foods usually come across on shipping containers that can take a while), there wasn't much time left before they expired.  However, I've had these cookies before, and I've had a lot of luck with keeping them frozen -- kept in the freezer, they'll last far beyond their expiry date.  And secondly, for some reason, the large bag was sealed over the top of the edges of some of the little bags, so if you opened the main bag with scissors, there's a good chance you'd accidentally open up one or two of the bags inside, too.  Open with care!",5
"I think this rub is fantastic! We used it on some pork chops the other day. Rub it over the chops and let them rest for about 20 minutes, then throw 'em on the grill. The flavor was excellent! Spicy, hot, and sweet without going too far in any direction. The balance was perfect!",5
"This product is delicious, I use 1 tablespoon per glass of seltzer.  Too bad the price just increased by an astounding $7 a bottle.  I cancelled my subscription and purchased another brand, Montmorency, which is almost as good",5
they don't provide splenda at the office so i bought one to keep at my desk - the packaging malfunctioned and now i can't get my splenda tabs out!,2
"I buy this, as well as the white sticky rice, for 2 of my kids with Celiac Disease. They love rice and this type is hard for me to replicate at home. The price through subscribe & save is definitely better than that found in the stores! The rice makes a convenient snack or sometimes I'll send it to school with them for lunch. (They have microwave accessibility.)",5
"My husband and I been using his Teriyaki marinade for years now and when I seen this on sale at Amazon I had to purchase to compare.  Just like expected, it's delicious for half the cost.  We use it for BBQ, stir fry and much much more. I'm drooling just writing about it! Highly recommend...Enjoy!",5
"The couscous was very good.  Easy to follow directions on the container, and it turned out well.  The price is low too, which is a bonus.",5
"This is really strong Chai tea, the leaves smell like a pack of Big Red and cinnamon/cloves are the strongest flavors.<br /><br />The resealable bag is pretty sturdy so even if you threw it against the wall your tea would still be safe, not really much else to say besides it's well packaged tea that tastes good.",5
"I ordered this, and had to add more chai spices to it. It is bland. The tea itself is not very tasty, and there is not enough of the chai spice in it. I won't order it again.",2
This is a great treat which all three of my dogs absolutely love!  I am now ordering it regularly and the price is great.,5
"I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!<br /><br />They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again.",5
"I bought a Vizsla puppy from a breeder who raises hunting dogs in WI. These are high activity dogs. This was the food he recommended. I've fed my puppy this since I've had her. She's an energetic, healthy dog. I would say the taste must not be great; she doesn't wolf it down when I feed her but she will eat it.",4
I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and it changed me. I was so impressed with how much of a boost it gave me without making me nervous or having racing heartbeat. I now use this almost everyday when I need a little pick me up- much better than reaching for soda or sugary snacks,5
"These are excellent chips, except Amazon couldn't get the order straight and twice sent me cases of Red Hot Blues. Great. What does a single person do with 2 cases of already flavored chips? Yep, give them away. I liked the Red Hots, but wanted these with no seasoning (I make my own salsas) for every day and Amazon just couldn't pull it off. The case was even clearly labelled.  Go figure. Amazon did refund my money fully.",5
I've always liked granola but this is the first granola that I've loved. Love Crunch Carrot Cake Granola is my new favorite breakfast and/or snack. It tastes exactly how it it is described on the package. This is some seriously delicious stuff. I mix it with vanilla yogurt and it tastes like dessert.,5
"This is a great product. I am French and bought it as it is a traditional Christmas sausage, just sauteed in butter with apples...wonderful. Tasted just like the ones in France and it was a big hit with all of our American friends. Highly recommend!",5
"As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a ""sugar crash"" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.",5
"The flavor is fantastic. I tend to like my peanut butter a little thicker, so I usually use a little less water. The richness of the oil which is no longer present in this product is certainly missed when the peanut butter is forced to compete with other flavors, such as in a sandwich... but as a light topping, this product is delicious.",5
"This is a great, sweeter alternative to regular PB2 (which I also absolutely adore). It is not very chocolatey, though, so don't go expecting anything near Nutella flavor. Still, for it's nutritional stats it's irreplaceable and the flavor is still quite delicious--it's not overwhelmingly ""peanutty"" either, so it makes a great middle-of-the-road compromise to satisfy cravings for something different while still being healthy. I've been using this and regular PB2 for about 4 years now and I'll never go back to regular nut butters! It's just too perfect to argue with. WONDERFUL for baking to infuse a chocolate-peanut flavor, and so easy to prepare, not to mention the shelf life is extended without adding hydrogenated oils like most churned peanut butters do!",4
"So I am still lamenting that Campbells discontinued their Pepper Pot soup.  I found this on Amazon when looking for a replacement.  The soup is OK.  You can tell that they attempted a quality product.  However, it is expensive and it is nothing like Campbell's Pepper Pot.  I grew up on that soup and yearn for the flavor.  I would love to find some cans of it somewhere.  Anyway, this is not it and not worth the money.",3
"Received these as a gift and could not be more pleased. The chocolates are fresher than I can find in the stores locally (the expiration date more than a year from now) and are absolutely delicious. Amazon shipped these in a styrofoam cooler with two ice packs, and even though it's 105*F outside and the chocolates have been sitting out in the sun after they got delivered (no one was home to accept the delivery), they were nice and cool when I opened the package.<br />A+ for both product and packaging.",5
I wanna give it zero star. I can't believe that they can make such a terrible snack stick. It's extremely salty and hard as a rock. The expiration date is just 2 months from now and it can't be returned. I am a huge Amazon fan. But this time I am very disappointed.,1
"Bought these locally a few years back and now we search for it every Christmas when it's available in the local stores.  If you're pruchasing as a gift for yourself or someone who knows good chocolate, this is a good choice - definately better than ""stovers"", which I think tastes like wax. Also, Merci is ""thank you"" in french for those that didn't know.",5
Pill pockets are easy to use...just pop in the pill and seal it up!  My dogs love the flavor and it definitely beats shoving them down their throats!,5
"I have used this in every baked good that I have made - from cookies to pancakes, it works really well.  I've gone through several boxes over the past few years and will continue to use this.  It's cheap, easy to use, and works well.",5
"Definitely came with 72 packets, but I kind of expected the box to be bigger. 72 packets fits into a pretty small box! $16 is a lot for gummy bears, but I guess I got what I ordered so I'm satisfied enough. If you want 'em bad enough, it's certainly as advertised! just be aware of what you're getting for your money.",3
I grew up in California using Lawry's and it wasn't until I moved and couldn't find it that I realized how great it was. There is no other on the market that can imitate or duplicate the taste my tacos get from using Lawry's. Thank you Amazon for making it available to me when ever I need it!,5
"I've been a big fan of Free Range Dog Chews but recently I found out that their chicken breast wraps treats that were used to manufacture in Brazil is now in China. This treats were one of the favorites of my dogs, but I will discontinue using them. I just can't trust dog food or treats made in China after having so many recalls regarding the ingredients from China. I went to their website, but it's no longer in use. I don't know if they are re-creating their website, but I'm hoping they get the ingredients source from Brazil again instead...",3
The bag I got from my vet does not list HFCS in the ingredients.  I was shocked to see it in the ingredients here and at other online stores.  I guess Butler has changed their formula recently?<br /><br />You have to be an extremely bad pet owner to knowingly give your dog HCFS or any type of sugar on a regular basis.<br /><br />What kind of sick company produces this?!,1
"I'm a little surprised that so many people didn't like these.  I loved them!  The texture and taste are both excellent, and they're filling as well.  Many other nutrition bars I've tried don't really curb my hunger, but these do.  It's nice to find something both filling and healthy.  I plan to keep buying these and try some of the other flavors, too.",5
"I have tried many snack and nutritional bars, and these are my current favorite. The combination of flavors not only satisfies my hunger but also satisfies my desire for something sweet. What turns me off about most fruit/nut bars is the syrupy sweet substance that holds the ingredients together. I don't taste that at all in any of the Kind bars. I have this particular variety on auto delivery.",5
"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!",5
"I know that today many manufacturers push this ""grain-free"" diet for dogs...reminds me of the Atkins diet for humans. Good for some not for everyone. Long story short, I tried to give my 65 pound border collie lab mix this food by slowly adding it to his diet. Within two weeks he developed awful diarrhea and started throwing up every now and again. Sure enough, once I stopped and replaced it with Fromm's duck and sweet potato (not completely grain free but still very good in my opinion)<br />and Fromm's Surf and Turf, he turned into a healthy dog he's always been. I am not trying to advertise Fromm foods here but just wanted to warn other about this particular Evo formula. It's not good for every dog.",2
"This is a great product and I am glad it is sold in America. If you don't have a croatian/european market nearby you that sells this, then by all means buy it. Otherwise, I would recommend picking it up yourself b/c shipping is a bit pricey (understandably though as it is heavy & breakable).<br /><br />Basically, it is a white chocolate spread and a chocolate-hazelnut (nutella-like) spread.",5
It's water. I've had it before and have no complaints about the plastic not being thick enough.  It holds my water.  Job done.  I'm 3 star on this because I'm a moron and payed no attention to the shipping charge.  I normally only purchase Prime items.  I guess the low cost of the water itself got me excited.  I just noticed how much I actually paid for this and it's already on it's way.  I'm going to have to savor every bit of this $36 case of water.  For this price you could get 5+ cases at your local store.,3
I was SO glad to find this on Amazon. I had been looking for it in the store for a long time. It absolutely makes the best cheeseball. The alternatives were better than nothing but this makes it delish!,5
These pancakes are the best tasting ones that I have ever made at home. They taste very similar to the ones I buy from Original Pancake House.<br />I found that you should put a little extra liquid in the mix if you don't want thick pancakes.,5
"These pretzels taste great! I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most ""regular"" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU"">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.",5
The taste of this product in my opinion is NASTY to say the least.<br /><br />Nestle's should bring back the recently discontinued (Milk Chocolate) flavor 50000 11164<br /><br />Nestle's you BLEW IT by dropping the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Not everyone likes coffee or hot chocolate that is so thick or taste like MUD!!!,1
This is the most delicious Italian vinaigrette we have ever eaten and we can only find it through amazon.  Thank You Amazon.,5
"I did NOT like this lemon lime flavor.  It made me gag.  It tastes like some kind of horrible medicine.<br /><br />The diet Cranberry was drinkable, I can tell how other people would like it but it was not my favorite.<br /><br />Dr. Pete is great!<br /><br />I have yet to try any other flavors.  I have made my own syrups to use with it instead.",1
"My baby is in love with these puffs. When we bring out the container, he gets so excited! They melt nicely in his mouth, which is good because he sometimes likes to stuff his mouth with a few at a time. Not only are they (to my knowledge the only) organic puffs, but they also have a fraction of the sugar compared to other brands.<br /><br />My baby loves the green, banana, and apple flavors. I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.<br /><br />As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack. However, my baby loves these so much, that we'll definitely use them before he outgrows them or they expire.",5
"I was tired of the standard bag of chips and could never finish a full bag. These Kettle brand chips are really good, crisp and the pepper adds great flavor to them.<br /><br />These chips are right up there with PopChips as two of the better brands one can get.",5
"I set this up around the area where my back gate opens.  Sometimes meter readers or other repairmen might leave the gate open, and just in case they did, the above ground fence was extra security.<br /><br />There is a downside to it.  It's not very attractive, and depending on how you lay it out, you might have to constantly step over the two wires yourself.<br /><br />I don't think anyone should rely on this as their only way of keeping a pet enclosed, but it does provide a good back up system.  I started using mine when my dog was still a puppy.  Unlike wireless systems, where the dog must wear a special collar and must be put through a training process, virutally no training is required here.  The first time the dog comes in contact with the wire, he or she will get shocked and won't go near it again.  My dog never even considers jumping over it, even though he easily could.<br /><br />There are some other drawbacks.  The very thin aluminum wires tend to break over time, and if the ground wire breaks off, the light will continue to blink, but the fence will not produce a shock.  I recommend you buy a spool of additional aluminum wire because you will need to replace the wire over time.<br /><br />By the way, the ""shock"" is not all that mild!  I recommend you find some unsuspecting soul to touch it to see if its working properly.",4
"I really liked the chocolate taste - similar to Slim-fast - but as is printed on the can it tastes better cold.  I didn't find it filling enough as a replacement for a breakfast meal (for men), but feel it would be perfect as a between-meal drink.  Women may be able to use it as a meal-replacement, however.  I asked a body-builder/personal trainer friend what he thought of it, and based only on the can he thought it would be fine as explained above.  His only comment was that 8 fat grams was a bit higher than he'd prefer, but otherwise looked good.",4
"Have now tried it on a number of different things including tacos and burritos, turkey burgers, cheeseburgers and as a veggie dip. In all cases, so-so. It is essentially a spicy mayo without any great character - about what you'd expect from Taco Bell, I suppose. In fact, I liked it best on the turkey burger where it took advantage of the turkey's natural blandness to stand out some. The creamy texture is nice, but all in all, I pretty undistinguished addition to the condiment world. Not terribly bold or spicy, but it got the creamy part right. A safe bet if you're looking for something to put out for company you don't know very well. Perfectly edible and forgettable.",3
"I'm very partial to canned sardines with tomato sauce.  I heat them in the microwave for about ten seconds and add ground pepper and a bit of ground sea salt and I'm good to go.  Yum!<br /><br />The Season product here surprised me with the bright red, fresh tasting tomato sauce.  There are some really good and bad sardine brands out there, but even among the best it seems that Season is a cut above.  Season is my favorite brand for small sardines.",5
"This popcorn is fresh and pops up big, but there is little flavor. Also, I've never used popcorn that produces so many hulls! That is NOT what I wanted.",3
"Great, real maple syrup. Organic. Delivered to my door. Can't ask for more than that. Flavor beats any maple syrup I get at the market [...].",5
"We were disappointed with the light, mild flavor and the thin liquidy syrup.  For a premium priced product, we expected something better than we bought at Costco, but this was not to our taste.  Sorry.",3
"I can see why this would be the best of what's available in the market. It is sweeter and there are tiny bits of coconut in the water, which makes it even better. Although, I do like Zico and I can't decide which one's better. This is still not nearly as good as the water from a fresh tender coconut. I will keep looking...",4
"My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!",1
LOVE this product.  I put a tablespoon of it into my smoothies every morning.,5
"I was looking for a selection of k-cups but having commitment issues. I just couldn't bring myself to commit to buy 24 cups of Vanilla Creme or Toffee or a certain decaf blend, without actually knowing what it tasted like. And the pre-packaged mixed selections already had half the flavors I wasn't interested in. This is an ingenious idea! I just ordered a wide selection of exactly what I wanted to taste. Ordered it Saturday, the seller emailed me back within two hours of receiving my order email, and mailed it out Monday morning. Package received Wednesday. Great service, all the flavors I want to try. Can't recommend this enough to folks!",5
My dog loves these chews. He asks for them every night. Much cheaper to buy them here than try to find them in stores.,5
"I understand that Ice tastes wonderful, however, it does contain ""green tea extract"" of which one of the main components is caffeine.  The product should contain an alert that it does contain caffeine -- many people, including myself, have an allergy to caffeine.",1
"I wasn't sure about this product. I figured it was a way to reduce the portions / increase the price. Well, actually, we like the smaller packets. No more open packets stuffed in ziplock baggies, stacking up in the cupboard. My husband actually went out and bought his own supply for his office.<br /><br />Same great taste; updated, convenient, on the go packets.<br /><br />As my 3-year-old grandson says: Good job!",5
"These are your classic Honey Maid graham crackers -- a long-time snack favorite -- repackaged into smaller packets. This makes some sense: With fewer crackers per packet, the others stay sealed where they won't get stale. Also, each packet is now a handy size that could fit in a pocket or a purse.<br /><br />You might want to think about how graham crackers are consumed in your household to see if this is a good fit. Do you go through packages fast or slow? If fast, then the staleness concerns may not even be a consideration. Would it be handy for you to take a packet on-the-go as a snack? If you're only going to eat them at home, the smaller packet size will be less important to you.",4
"This Ras El Hanout is a wonderful, authentic  spice that is difficult to recreate yourself.  It's hard to find and really enhances Middle Eastern cuisine.  This blend  includes lavender and roses, as well as more common cinnamon and cumin. Ras El Hanout gives a distinctive Middle Eastern flavor to a dish.  I use it in my Moroccan chicken, which I prepare in a crock pot.  A tagine would of course be even better!  For my recipe, I use organic  boneless chicken, a few tablespoons of high quality extra virgin olive oil,  potatoes or sweet potatoes,  quartered onions, lots of ""baby"" carrots, chick peas, cans of whole or diced tomatoes, diced garlic, honey, diced/chopped dried fruit such as apricots and/or prunes, chopped preserved lemon (you can buy or very easy to make), and then some  additional cinnamon and cumin, plus black pepper in addition to Ras Al Hanout to taste.  You do want to add enough to really flavor the ""stew.""  Moroccan chicken is very healthy and  fantastic served over whole wheat couscous.  For a lower carb version, you can omit the potatoes and serve over greens.  My kids love it, but it's also special enough for company.  If you enjoy Moroccan food or experimenting with spices, it's a great addition to your pantry!",5
"""Caibou Daybreak Morning Blend"" has just enough caffeine to get you going in the AM without the caffeine overload feelings that stronger blends provide.  I drink a cup black and I'm on my way without any empty stomach jitters.",5

"'Tried this at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada at a little cafe when it was very hot.  It's really terrific...kind of floral and carbonated.  It's like a non-alcoholic version of the Saint Germaine liquer.  Thanks, amazon, for carrying this...I plan to order this on a regular basis!",5
"I was disappointed with this tonic water, especially after shelling out the big bucks. It tastes flat and boring. I found it did not hold up to gin so tried it with vodka and was still disappointed with the results. My usual tonic water is Fever Tree and I find it to be a far superior mixer--bolder, crisper and cleaner. For gin and tonics, I prefer gins that are heavy on the juniper (Tanquery 10 is my favorite). If your taste runs toward milder gins, the Q Tonic may suit you better than it did me. Also, if you're looking to cut calories, Q Tonic is definitely a better option than the chemical-packed-diet tonic waters. However, if you're a true gin aficionado, stick with Fever Tree.",3
Great gift basket except most everything in it was the same - different size packets of Irish creme coffees - needed more variety,3
"I ate these as a kid and then I married and moved and didn't often find them in the stores.  I haven't had any in years.  Received the first box of them today and STILL LOVE THEM.  They came in glass when I was young, in cans now, but the taste is still there.  I am quickening up the pace of the deliveries.  They are definitely five star to me.",5
Price is good and service is great in getting the shipment.<br />  Quality is excellent.,5
"I was never a fan of instant coffee until Starbuck's came out with Via. Now a bag of these little packets is one of the first things into my suitcase when I travel (which is often).<br /><br />Even in good hotels the quality of the coffee service in the room is quite variable, and now I know I'll have a decent cup of coffee no matter what the hotel offers.",5

"I first tried this incredible sauce at the NOODLES INC restaurant with a udon noodles type of dish with chicken breast and cilantro and bean sprouts. OMG !! this sauce is unique, sweet, perky and garlicky and this fresh kind of hotness you wont believe. I immediately went to King Soopers and bought the noodles, sprouts , cilantro and chicken and the Sauce to make this at home. YUMMMM !!",5
This is a fairly hot (my wife thinks it's Hell's Fire) but not to extreme and a very tasty condiment. It is a thick suace with a good flavor not just a hot runny liquid like some hot sauces. A bargain for the price paid.,4
"The largest skipjack tuna are given to the sushi bars and poke sellers to be eaten raw as sushi, sashimi, or poke.  That's especially true if the skipjack tuna is caught in U.S., Japanese, or Australian waters.  Costco's Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna contains some of the largest skipjack tuna that were caught near Thailand.  One can of Costco's Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna contains 7 ounces of tuna meat compared to only 5 ounces of tuna meat per can in this product, which contains 48 cans per pack.  Costco's product contains 12 cans per pack and usually sells for about $15.99.  The tuna meat in this product is somewhat more flakier (lower in quality) than the tuna meat in Costco's product, which uses the highest quality, solid, shoulder meat area of the skipjack tuna fish.  However, the quality of the tuna meat in this product isn't too bad.  I've seen even flakier (less solid) tuna meat in the cheapest tuna cans sold at some supermarkets.  Both Costco's tuna product and this tuna product come from Thailand but I've noticed that ""Product of Thailand"" is suddenly no longer printed on this tuna product from Amazon.com.  Interestingly, by weight, only 10% of all tuna fish are caught in the entire Atlantic Ocean plus Mediterranean Sea.  By weight, 22% of all tuna fish are caught in the Indian Ocean and 68% of all tuna fish are caught in the Pacific Ocean.  Shark fishing is illegal in the Atlantic Ocean but legal in the Pacific Ocean.  I wonder if that has anything to do with why tuna fish prefer to inhabit the Pacific Ocean.  By weight, about 60% of all tuna fish caught are skipjack tuna, about 24% are yellowfin tuna, about 10% are bigeye tuna, about 5% are albacore tuna, and the remaining 1% is bluefin tuna according to Wikipedia.",4
"Bought this as a Christmas present for a candy lover in his 50's.  He got a kick out of the amount plus the kinds of candy.  He raved about this present for a while, definitely worth buying!!!",5
"I'm a pretty big cereal and granola fan.  You'd have to botch up pretty badly to make me not like your cereal - Kind Healthy Grains has botched up pretty badly.  On the initial bite, it wasn't too bad...it has a good crunch and tastes like a pretty decent granola.  I really didn't detect a blueberry taste to it, nor did I see any actual dried blueberries in there.  The vanilla taste was a little artificial tasting, but I kept eating anyways.  Then the weird flavor started kicking in.  The vanilla taste started tasting more and more nappy tasting, and when I stopped eating for a little bit, I got the worse aftertaste in my mouth.  I'm presuming it was from the flax seeds, but having eaten flax seeds in a lot of cereals and from the fresh flax I put in my yogurt, I'm not sure if that was the cause of the problem.  The aftertaste of this granola is pretty bad.  It just doesn't taste right - kinda like a mix between musty old nuts and artificial vanilla flavoring.<br /><br />I tried eating this granola with milk and it was still pretty bad.  My two preschoolers didn't seem to mind the cereal much, although I noticed that when I offered it to them after that initial bowl that they never wanted it again.  I'm guessing that means that they probably tasted that funky aftertaste, too.  After this experience, I'm probably not going to buy this cereal again.  Not recommended.",2
The taste is very good (blueberry-vanilla) but the product was devoid of any clusters. Maybe my bags were filled with the chaff at the bottom of the cluster barrel.,3

"I love peanut butter. I love chocolate. This stuff is absolutely amazing. I am on a diet so I am always looking for variety to a dull boring calorie count. One apple, sliced and 2 tbsp of this chocolately pb is only 215 calories! It's very filling and lots of protein! I can easily make a lunch of this every day. It's much more expensive in my grocery stores and what a deal for 6 jars. This stuff is so addictive and so good!!",5
"I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!",3
"I've been drinking tea in the morning for over 30 years.  Taylors of Harrogate Tea is just about the best I've tasted thus far.  The tea itself is flavorful and the bergamot flavoring is strong enough but not overwhelming (and made with real oil of bergamot).  I recently had to buy Twinings Earl Grey when I ran out of the Taylors and was pretty amazed by the difference.  Twinings doesn't claim to use real oil of bergamot and you can taste the difference, it tastes like fake lemon flavor and the background flavor of the tea itself is pretty bland.  I have to say that not much compares to the quality of the Taylors of Harrogate tea.",5
"My mother-in-law suffers from night-time leg cramps.<br />Since she began taking it, before bed,the frequency of her cramps has decreased significantly. Buying it on-line cuts it's cost in half. She's not crazy about it's taste but a good night's rest makes up for it.",4
"LOVE the quinoa, cooks up beautifully, tastes awesome.  The only problem I have with this product is the fact that the cooking directions are incorrect.  I've been working with quinoa for years, and the standard method is 1 cup quinoa to 2 cups water.  For some odd reason, the instructions on the bag only call for one and 1/4 cups water to one cup of quinoa.  I thought perhaps this company did something different during the drying process to make cooking require less water, so I tried it as per the directions the first time I cooked it - the quinoa was dry and badly under-done.  When I tried again with 2full cups of water, it came out perfectly.<br /><br />The incorrect directions don't matter all that much to me, but for people who've never worked with quinoa before, this could be a pretty big problem. It won't stop me from repurchasing, however, b/c this brand is very economical & the quality of the product itself is perfect.",4
"I knew from previous experience that this candy is small and not the greatest for blowing bubbles.  However, the flavor is simply delightful even though it lasts little more than 10-15 seconds.  My personal favorite by far is the strawberry flavor.  I bought this ""variety pack"" because I'd never tried the orange or melon flavors.  I didn't think they had as good a flavor and the flavor wasn't as intense as the strawberry or grape. Anyways, I think y'all should try this at least once in your life!",4
"These juice pouches are delicious.  I buy them for my daughter's lunch, but ultimately I end up packing a few in my lunch too.  They come in a few different flavors, but the grape is my favorite.  Does not taste artificial like Capri Sun, and has less sugar than the average fruit drink.  If you order using Subscribe & Save the price is less than $0.62/pouch!",5

"This is my first experience with matcha powder tea made at home.  It is difficult to get to froth and much more of the powder is needed than I originally thought.  I like the taste (bitter) but don't see much benefit to powder vs loose tea.  Although, clean up is very easy.",3

"I'll preface this by saying that I have always like Naan bread - when it is done correctly.  However, I have often been disappointed with the usual commercial offerings; too tough, soggy, flavorless, etc.<br /><br />This Masala Flat Bread / Naan, is just about as good as any I have tasted and certainly as good as the batches I have made at home.  Heated as directed, it is tender with perfectly balanced flavor and excellent as a base for the toppings or fillings of your choice.  Since I received this order I have used these to make pizza, wrapped kebabs inside with labneh yogurt, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes.<br /><br />There are too many ways of using this product for me to list here.  I have just begun to experiment.",5

"I ordered these K cups thinking that they were going to satisfy my craving for coffee and come to find out these K cups have done the exact opposite.  I arrived home after a long day at work and saw the box on my doorstep.  I was pretty excited to try these and proceeded to make one.  Not even 2 mins later I hear a ""BOOM"".  Come to find out I walk in the kitchen and see a complete disaster.  Not 1, not 2, not 5, but 10 k cups out of 15 that I made EXPLODED coffee grounds all over my kitchen. I am completely dissatisfied and went right then to buy a drip coffee maker.  I will say though that the coffee was pretty good when it didnt explode but its a gamble to make them knowing that there is a possiblitly of an extra 5 mins work of cleanup to follow about 2/3's of the kcups.  Thanks alot for all the extra work.",2
"Folgers is much better.  Stronger and just has more flavor.  this was ok, but i don't think i would get it again.",2

"I tried making eggrolls with these, and they just totally don't work if you're going to fry them. The rice paper sticks to the papertowels, and to the other eggrolls, and they fall apart when you try to remove them. When they're first wet and wrapped, they're really flimsy as well. They easily fall apart. Not good for real eggrolls. I'm dumping these things, as I have no use for them.",1
"As others have noted, these don't arrive as cookies.  They arrive as crumbs.  And, on top of that, the crumbs I received tasted stale.  Customer lost.",1
No funny after taste for me! Rich and SO MUCH BETTER than the green mountain coffee which is watery and artificial tasting.  Not as good of course as a cafe hot cocoa but best one I've found for the keurig.,4

"These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The ""Regular"" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs.",5
"I just got these today, I ordered the Parmesan. They are pretty good, I would rather have cheez-its or my favorite chips, but if you are really trying to eat healthier and add protein to your diet, these are really good. The whole bag is about 150 calories, and over 10 grams of protein, and there are enough in each bag for a good snack. I will order again.",5
"These nuts are delicious. Not too heavily coated or sickeningly sweet, they have a fantastic taste that goes down beautifully. And the price isn't too bad. Especially considering they come all the way from Hawaii.<br />These nuts are definitely one of my favorites.",5

"There really isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been covered. A energy shot needs to provide a boost of energy and (hopefully) be decent tasting. This is decent tasting, better than 5 hour energy but perked me up for a hour or less when 5 hour seems to give me around 3 hours of boost.",3

"Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states ""IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA"". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a ""Raw Food"" and not as ""Nutritious"" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.",1
"I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy.",2
"I have tried any number of substitute sweeteners (most of which are loaded with fillers and artificial stuff), especially stevia and xylitol. This is by far the best I have come across.<br /><br />It is quality produced in that there are no fillers and only pure water is used in the extraction process. It is NOT GMO grown (like Truvia is).  It is VERY sweet! When it says a small packet of the fine powder is equal to 2 teaspoons of sugar....you better believe it! I use about one half a packet to 8 oz of coffee.<br /><br />There is no after taste and the sweetness does taste ""natural"", to me anyway.<br /><br />This is my sweetener from now on.......I was using NOW xylitol, which is good, but I can't get used to eating something made from corn husks.",5

"Unfortunately, I found this tea to have a simply awful taste.<br />I did not mind the box haphazardly-crammed full of 100 tea envelopes, but the tea itself has a nasty bitter taste--I have used lots of different kinds of ginger teas, so I believe I know how ginger tea should taste.<br />I was surprised to find that one of the ingredients is citric acid, though I don't understand why they would include that ingredient in an herbal tea.",1
All time favorite herbal tea.  I buy it by the 100 count box so I never run out.  I drink it all year but it is a must have for cold and flu season.,5

"My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats. I've tried offering them to her and she won't eat it.

I plan on trying the chicken one soon to see if she likes that one, but I don't think it'll win her over",2
my finicky dog (small yorkie mix) just loves these little peanut butter snacks. so glad that I came across these!,5
"I love a good balsamic vinegar. I remember the first time I tried it with olive oil and amazingly delicious crusty bread. Years ago I moved to SoCal and my cousin took me to her favorite Italian restaurant. Our waiter brought out the bread basket and plates and my cousin requested that he make us a plate of olive oil and vinegar for us. I watched her as she dipped her bread in it. I thought I'd give it a try and see how I liked it.<br /><br />Oh heaven. How we love you so. Whenever I eat something amazing I feel like it's just a taste of heaven. And taking that first bite of bread with oil and vinegar was like stepping into heaven. Dramatic, maybe just a bit. But when something alerts all of your senses in a wonderful way -- isn't that what heaven is going to be like? (Mine is, anyway!)<br /><br />Cut to going to the store to buy olive oil and vinegar. Hmmmm... it's almost the same. But the vinegar is runnier and not as amazing tasting. In fact I stopped buying it for dipping in bread and just wait until I go out. I haven't been able to create at home the same experience. Until now.<br /><br />Welcome FINI Balsamic Vinegar.<br /><br />It is thick, it is rich and it is the perfect balance between sour and sweet. I add it to EVERYTHING. For example tonight I sauteed some greens and yellow bell pepper. To give it some added flavor I drizzled some of the Fini vinegar over it. It was amazing. Thank you Fini for adding to my veggies.<br /><br />It's sooooo good. And yes, put it with some amazing extra virgin olive oil and an amazing loaf of crusty bread and you too will have welcomed heaven into your life as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!",5
"My review is pretty much in the title. The coffee itself was fantastic. Great flavor and I highly recommend it for any coffee lovers out there.<br />The only trouble I had was in the shipping.

The Brown Gold was more palatable, however certain flavors with this brand also feel short in particular the Costa Rican named product was extremely too bitter.  I would agree with most that this does give you a lower cost per serving, but when the coffee is inferior and the taste match is also, I think the best descriptor is cheap.",2
"My wife and I love strong coffee, this and the jet fuel are our favorite! If you like strong coffee, give it a try....<br />Update to show how much we like it, I just placed our 3rd order in as many months.",5
"Great flavor.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000UV2OI"">Preserved Meyer Lemon in Olive Oil</a>  Works especially well with Israeli couscous, served with fish.",5
"My dog has gotten really picky and won't eat anything.  I tried Castor and Pollux Ultramix<br />along with several other gluten free type dog foods.  He loves the food.  Not always available in local pet stores, so I decided to try to find it at Amazon because they seem to have everything.  Ordered and received with free shipping.  The free shipping was a real bonus because 12 cans of dog food are heaverier then most packages and would probably make the food over $3.00 a can.  The food is great and very convenient to order online.  But be careful when shipping is not a special deal.",5
"Frustrating. Order was for 24, 15 oz cans of Goya Gandules. Received order today of 24 14 oz bags of dried gandules.",1
"Tastes like a Payday candy bar but with protein and a genuinely nutty taste.  These bars are great for on-the-go, in your handbag, purse, or backpack and actually fill you up with a bottle of water and an apple for a healthy meal.  I don't recommend refrigeration, as they are already chewy and don't need to be hard on top of that.  I recommend these bars for athletes, students, moms, and kids alike.  They taste great and are very satisfying.",4
"After trying Blue Horse's Medium Roast and finding the flavor much too mild/weak for my taste, I decided to try Blue Horse's Dark Roast. The dark roast is perfect for me! I don't like bold coffees (e.g. Starbucks), so I was worried that this dark roast would be too bold. The coffee beans SMELL bold, but the brewed coffee tastes just right! If you're looking for a bold coffee, this is NOT the right coffee for you. This coffee has a smooth consistency and a not-quite-bold (but definitely not weak) taste. Very good! For reference, I think this coffee tastes very similar to Hawaii Roasters' Medium Roast (which I also recommend to Kona lovers!).",5
I'm very impressed with the quality of these vanilla beans...!  They arrived very plump and moist....  lots of yummy paste when you split them...!  All at a terrific price...  I just ordered more...!,5
"I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control  I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it.  I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast.  I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience.  I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact.",3
"We have bought these many times at Walgreens- I've seen them at K-mart as well. The big difference is they are not $3 per box, they are only $1. Don't waste your money getting them on here!",5
"The gift shop at the hotel I work at started carrying these the same day I had to pull a super long work shift and forgot lunch.  I bought one, though they had the other varieties as well (Which are just as amazing) and I was surprised at the amount of food in the little box.<br /><br />Inside is a plastic knife, a piece of hard toffee wrapped up in foil and then plastic, a packet of turkey pepperoni, a packet of multi-seed rice based crackers that are very light and crisp, more than enough cheese spread to make your own little sandwiches of the crackers cheese and pepperoni, also dried fruit that wasn't actually too sugary for once.<br /><br />The box opens up so that you can use it as an eating container if need be, but it'd be difficult to spread cheese on crackers in it so I just laid out a napkin for that.  There was also a sudoku puzzle inside.<br /><br />Though pricier than a lunchable, I found this much more satisfying,  I don't eat a lot and i don't think it would satisfy the average adult, but this would be a fantastic meal for children or small eaters.  Best, they don't require refrigeration, so you can take them on long trips.<br /><br />I'll probably be buying these when my family heads out to the anime convention next summer, since the food at the convention center is expensive and sub-par, it'd be nice to have something my family can carry with them.<br /><br />This is also a great meal if you're dieting, as there's enough protein and lean fats to keep you feeling a bit fuller than the average under 300 calorie meal would.",5
"As others have noted, this jerky is chopped and formed.  It also is too greasy for my taste, but for those who like a rich jerky, it may be just what you are looking for.",3
"This is the best oatmeal I've ever eaten.  It takes a long time to cook, but it's worth it.  The instant McCann's is also extremely good.",5
"I was very impressed with the service, quality, quantity, and price of McCanns Steel Cut Oatmeal. I used to have it made for me by my mother and I used to buy it where I lived. But now live in place where slection of any kind is very bad. So this was my first time ordering food stuffs on the net and I was very happy with it.",5
"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these!",1
These popchips are the best and they only have 100 calories per bag!  I can have a bag everyday they are so good.,5
I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.,2
"These delicious mini-crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful. Yep, it's got all the organic requisites, organically-fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics (well, maybe these are injected, I don't know), and the crackers contain non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free organic palm oil.<br /><br />The taste is mild but you can taste the cheddar, and the texture is more flakey than hard or brittle. If you grab 30 crackers (one ounce, there are 5ounces, or 150 crackers per box), you'll get 310 mg of sodium, or 13% of the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Now that's by any means low-sodium, but you can easily eat half of that and feel you've had a snack. Per 30 crackers, there are 4.5 grams (g) oftotal fat, of which 1.5 are saturated, and none are trans fat. Total carbohydrates are 19g, including less than 1g of sugar, but also less than 1g of dietary fiber. Hey, noone said this is health food, but compare this to what you're snacking on now (and that cheese gives it 3g of protein).<br /><br />Full ingredients and nutritional information may be found at latejuly.com/products, but other good stuff includes organic wheat flour, organic whey, sea salt, and organic evaporated cane juice. Nothing artificial, no corn syrup, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and they're both Kosher and Lacto Vegetarian (gotta make sure there's no meat in your crackers...). If that's not enough, ""Late July"" is independently owned and family operated.<br /><br />Mainly, though, it's the light taste, the organic ingredients, and that enticing small size you can grab by the fistful.  Full information at the above-mentioned website.",5
"My dog LOVES these bones.  I haven't used them long enough to see if they will have a positive effect on tartar on his teeth, but breaking these bones down requires a lot of gnawing which in turn should be effective for tartar control.  I love that they contain minimal ingredients and I know EXACTLY what my do is eating when I give him one of these bones.",5
tastee but I wish they had a sampler selection as I would love to try a various selection of different flavors but due to the cost really can't justify to buy a whole box. what if I hated it?,4
"This extract really works well. I used two tablespoons to make a half gallon of excellent eggnog flavored yoghurt. Most extracts (e.g., vanilla) do not work well for this application.",5
Great Product. Looked and looked for this product in area stores - glad to be able to find the large size available on line.,5
The peppermint tea is very enjoyable.  The taste and scent are not overwhelming or overpowering yet there is the true taste and aroma of peppermint.  I also tried it over ice and found it very refreshing.,5
"About 3 years ago I was intrigued with all health benefits associated with green tea.<br /><br />I decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />I should mention that since my late teens I had been a drip (black)coffee lover (no cream or sugar the stronger the better).<br /><br />I started out with the usual Safeway green tea brands...Bigelow, Stack,  etc... and while the tea was o.k. and I began slowly replacing my usual 10 cups of java a day with the green tea I was concerned about the price....20 tea bags for about an average of 3  bucks.<br /><br />One day I walked into an asian supermarket here in Seattle and found a green tea I had never tried before...Stassen Jasmine Green Tea.<br /><br />I always thought there was nothing like the smell of fresh brewed coffee in the morning ...and I still treasure that aroma..but now I enjoy  Stassen Jasmine Green Tea and how its delicate aroma is part of the enjoyment of sipping this health laden beverage.<br /><br />Never thought coffee would take the back seat to tea (I still have one cup of black coffee every afternoon so that we remain friends though not as close as we once were) but that's what this wonderful Stassen Jasmine Green Tea has done to me.<br /><br />I drink a lot of it.  I feel less jittery. It doesn't have that acidy thing about it like coffee and I just feel flat out more healthy drinking it.  And I never tire of inhaling that captivating jasmine with every cup I pour.<br />I also find the 100 bag box of Stassen Jasmine Green Tea a far better value than what Safeway has to offer.",5
I really love this stuff - and it's healthy. Its all natural stevia sweetner with a lemon flavoring. I love it in my team in the morning and the only local supplier went out of business.,5
"Pretty good flavor, but not very soft. I guess it's the price you pay for sugar<br />free....",3
"Ghirardelli absolutely makes the best baking bars out of all the different brands within a reasonable price range.  I like to eat these bars straight without even using them to bake because they have such wonderful undertones in the deep chocolate flavor.  Hershey's and Baker's have nothing on this bar; those taste too processed and chalky.  I definitely recommend this bar if you like unsweetened chocolate for snacking, and would definitely recommend this for your baking needs, too.<br /><br />One note about the price, though - it is a pretty good deal to get this for $3.50 a bar.  However, if you can, try to wait for the 12-pack to come into stock so that you can get a better bulk price, and also free shipping, since the shipping for just one bar is kind of steep.",5
"I love the root beer, orange punch, coconut, grape and Himalayan Sea Salt...also the chipotle is a nice contrast of sweet and spice.  All natural and great tasting what a great combination.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007J6HMWW"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Coconut Jelly Beans</a>",5
"I adore the plain chocolate Sans Sucre but this is awesome, too.  Slightly less intense chocolate flavor, but feels denser and more creamy.  I love both!",5
"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.",2
"This tea delivers on aroma but seriously fails in the taste department.  I'm not sure if the quality has gone down hill over time (lots of rave reviews), but I find this tea to almost be undrinkable.  I couldnt believe how bad it tasted so I had tried an endless amount of combinations on steeping time and amount used, to no avail.  The bergemont is there in smell, but all I taste is an overpowering bitter lemon.  Also, if steeped beyond 3:30, it becomes very bitter and gathers a really awful taste in my experience.  The only reason I am still drinking it is because I can't bring myself to throw away a pound of tea.  My advice would be to steep for 3 mins.  It'll be a little weak, but won't taste as undrinkable as 4 mins does (which is a typical steep time for blacks).  Or spend a little more money on something like Twinings.<br /><br />Easily a 2-star tea if it weren't for the extremely low price.",3
"The item I received did not match the picture or item name. I received a package of large, gummy stars in a SweetGourmet.com sealed bag. It did have a printed/copied label that said ""Swedish Fish Swediesh Gum Fish Aqua Life"" but the contents were not the Swedish Fish brand or the same as those pictured. Since I was looking for the Aqualife assortment, it does not meet my needs or expectations.<br /><br />It was shipped and received in a timely fashion.",1
"i tried to be a conscientious consumer but there is not any info on AMAZON of where  the country of product origin is. BTW it is a product of a South American country which means that the cattle this was derived from injested the toxic chemicals that are sprayed as pesticides , chemicals banned in the US.<br /><br />its a 6 pound bag and they are large but I will not risk my dogs life.",2
"I've had a couple other cinnamon-flavored k-cups, but I think this is the best tasting one.  I prefer either a breakfast blend or flavored coffee.  I love this with Cinnabon creamer, but is great with half & half too.  Definitely shop around, though.  You can buy the same product for much less on other sites.",5
"My initial reaction, after trying a few flavors, was 'bleh!' and a solid 2-stars. After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE"">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92"">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.",3
"I found this tea on sale/discontinued in a local grocery store and decided to try it.  This is a rooibos (red tea) based, not black tea.  So, it should appeal to herbal tea fans.  The tea has a very sweet aroma when brewed, even before adding sweetner.  And the vanilla makes it more naturally sweet. I usually use 2 bags of splenda in a cup of tea, but this only needed one.  Also, the vanilla is very mild, not overpowering as I have found with other teas.  The pomegranate flavor is subtle, with just a hint of tartness. Overall, a very nice afternoon tea.  This one would be great for kids.<br /><br />According to the can, $1 from every can sold is donated to breast cancer research.",5
If you like wasabi and mustard this stuff is pretty good. I've purchased two cases so far. I'd like to see it a little hotter but that's just me. It's a hard product to find locally so I just buy it on Amazon. It's easier and just as cheap even with shipping. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes spicy products.,4
Bought some of these in New Mexico at a co-op store and couldn't find them locally in Florida. Bought on line thru Amazon at a lower price and free shipping. The candy is wonderful and it's truly a sweet deal.,5
"I tried this once before on Amazon and my family really loves it because it is good for any pasta dish or many other recipes that call for sauce or just for dipping.  This sauce really sticks to the pasta where others just surround it and it has a fresh Italian taste in many varieties and comes in large sizes so that you will have enough in one jar and if you don't use it all, you can refrigerate the rest in the jar and use it later.",5
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",1
"The salsa is incredible, but not for this price. One can order the same salsa from El Fenix's website for $29.50... less than HALF of the price offered here.",1
"Our ten year old doxie...Annie NEVER, that's right, NEVER would eat ANY dry food UNTIL....Harmony Farms Healthy & Holistic Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food that we bought from you! Every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food! Amazon...you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17.5 pound bag of Harmony Farms Dog food from you...we'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag.  Wow! So happy about this...",5
"I've been giving these pork chomp knotz to my Shiba Inu puppy since he was just 3 or 4 months old. He is 11 months old now and these are by far his favorite thing to chew on. He's about 30 lbs and these 3-4"" knotz are perfect for his mouth size. I just got a 9 week old puppy and I've gotten him the mini knotz as well and he really enjoys chewing on these. It's perfect for teething pups and for older dogs as well. They love the taste as far as I can tell and always chew through the whole thing! Highly recommend!!",5
"My cats like it and I know the ingredients are healthy but I am switching back to PetGuard.  PetGuard has never had recalls and Natuarl Balance seems to have a lot (usually their dry foods with venison). Still, I am not taking chances with my two cats.  Other than the recall issue, the product is liked by my cats and the ingredients are healthy/ no by-products.",4
"This is the best coffee on the market, bar none.  My wife and I were introduced to it in San Diego in 1980 and were sold on its rich flavor from the first sip.  Can't get on the East Coast, except on the internet. Thank God for that!",5
"I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor.",2
"The product was received quickly.  The amount of the product expected was 2 lbs.  The contents are actually 1 lb. 12 oz.'s.  The sugar is very pretty and bakes well.  It comes in a resealable, heavy plastic bag.",4
I love them.  I wish they have the black currant only tubes.  That is what I remember from childhood,5
I chose this product as I am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products. This goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry. It keeps me full till lunch time. I worry about the fat content however. I probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that.,5
"My sampler pack arrived the day after I ordered it, so kudos for quick delivery! Although I bought the 35 cup sampler, there were only 33 cups in the box, so the people packaging should be more careful. I would have made a stink about it, but since it's a great deal I thought it wasn't worth the time to complain. None of my cups were damaged.<br /><br />On to the coffee: I received a nice sampling of coffees...I think I got at least one of every coffee shown in the picture. Many were doubles, which is fine by me, and I was pleased that there were 7 decaf cups included (including the half caf). I'm loving the medium roast coffees so far...we have found the light roasts to be a little on the weak side (especially the flavored coffees), and this is a great way to sample different kinds without committing to a whole box. I recommend this option if you are new to the K Cups or you're looking for something different to try.<br /><br />So, overall, we are happy with this purchase. I would have given it 5 stars if they had given me all 35 k cups!",4
"This is such a great dog food! I have 4 dogs who were soooo happy on the food bought through Trader Joe's. Fast forward 4 mos and we're living far from a TJ's. Thank God for Amazon! Food is delivered every 4 wks and happy,gas-free dogs rule the world. Always my 1st place to search for my favorite things.",5
"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.",3
"Unfortunately, we were very disappointed in this soup. I heated some and tasted it and threw it away. I will be donating the rest of the cans. Will not order this again.",1
"This is a new brand for me.  I prefer natural and organic products and am doing my best to do the same in my baking ingredients.  I am very happy with my results of using this lemon extract.  It is so hard to find larger bottles of lemon extract locally, and since I bake for my church regularly, it is more cost effective to buy larger bottles which, in the end, is cheaper than buying multiple small ones.  I will be ordering Cook's extracts again.",5
"I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.",3
I switched to the 4 pack because the price is better but is out of stock more often. This is a nice alternative to tasteless bread and peanut butter,4
I love this jam! It does not taste sugar free. I no longer eat any other jam. I served this jam to my family and they had no idea it was sugar free.,5
"I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for ""green"" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again.",1
"I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?",4
"I thought this was a fabulous product for the price.  Great in salads, great on meat and vegetables . Well worth buying for your own pantry and would make a good gift as well.",4
"My pug is, perhaps, too spoiled when it comes to treats. I ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. She turned her nose away. I chopped it and added gravy. She ate the gravy. So I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product.",2
"Yes, you read correctly! I was in PetSmart today, and I was looking for some all-natural cat treats, and ended up talking to a Blue Buffalo rep. She let me in on a little secret. Blue Buffalo doesn't sell cat treats, per se, but she said she'd been feeding her cats these treats, and they gobble them up! Well, I took her advice and grabbed a bag of them. I had my cat try them when I got home, and sure enough, she loved them! Hooray for Blue Buffalo. I have been converted! :)",5
"I liked that once I switched my baby from Enfamil to Earth's Best that my baby seemed more content and a lot less gassy.  However, after using for a month, I noticed that my baby throws up a lot.  Not sure if it is the formula, but I am going to try Nestle/Gerber's new probiotic formula and see if she responds better.  I'll report back!",3
used many brands over the years; this is BY FAR THE BEST I've ever used.  All good ingredients - you'll love it too.,5
"I love drinking Zico's coconut water.  In camparison to all others, I find ZICO's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as I'm from an Island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage.  HOWEVER, their packaging certainly makes a difference DO NOT purchase ZICO's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience ""PLASTIC"".  ZICO's carton packing is much, much better!!!  ENJOY",2
The Cheddar Popchips are my favorite flavor. They are addictive. Glad they are a healthy option. We always have a case on hand of one or more flavors.,5
"I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste ""weight"" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.",5
"These almonds which only are described as ""Dry Roasted"" are covered in a crusty sweet garlic/MSG flavor and are DISGUSTING.  Watch out these are not just plain dry roasted almonds!!!",1
I am very upset.  This product was listed as able to use in a Tassimo.  I opened it and it cannot be used in my machine and according to the information I cannot return because it has been opened!!,1
"I'm a professionally trained pastry chef, and I have to say I was blown away at the high quality of the product. I'm usually averse to using mixes, but the Cherrybrook Kitchen products do a great job at balancing exceptional flavor with non-dairy ingredients.<br /><br />I've baked out the chocolate cake, yellow cake and brownie mixes several times and they always come out as expected. The frosting mixes are also exceptional and offer room for modulating the ingredients if you prefer to use butter/margarine blends for richness - not vegan, I know, but the flavor isn't lost either way.<br /><br />The sugar content is low, which helps to keep the calorie count down on these cakes - for those dieting, or watching their sugar intake. Overall, I highly recommend these cake and frosting mixes.<br /><br />A note about baking:  home ovens vary in temperature for a variety of reasons. If you suspect that your oven temps are not what they should be, invest in an oven thermometer to make sure you are heating to the proper temps. These mixes absolutely perform as the written instructions provide, but you need to make sure you preheat and reach the correct temperatures, and then maintain them by not opening the oven door constantly.",5
"I have candida and if you have it or know what it is, then you know what I'm talking about. This pasta made from Quinioa is fabulous! I'ts way better that rice pasta because it doesn't get mushy, but don't over cook it either. Six to seven minutes max.  Good luck and enjoy.",5
"We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.",5
"This lemon-flavored herbal tea surpasses all similar teas of other brands, and I tried them all.  From obscure, expensive boutique teas to grocery store teas.  I am so afraid that Lipton will stop making it.  My favorite products always have a habit of being discontinued, for some reason.  We used to be able to get it in any grocery store, but gradually the tea became harder to find, and currently, it's only available on line.  This tea is full-bodied, fragrant, light, lemony, but not ""herby, or grassy or with hay overtones"".  I drink it day and night, summer and winter, hot or cold, with no additional sweeteners.  It's perfect the way it is.",5
"The Coffee  tastes great, but in ever box, there are at least one or two K-Cups that are defective; specifically, the the coffee grounds leak out into the coffee.",3
"not really sure how i can review a product i can't taste, so i'll go by my cats reaction to this. i have 2 good eaters and one fusspot!. well, now miss fusspot jumps on the counter while i'm opening the cans and i have to feed her first! she has turned into a total pig!. i'm hooked on the stuff. I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.",5
I am an American blessed to be able to go to Belgium on occasion to get REAL chocolate. This is some of that and it is great to be able to get it in America. It is ground finer and has less fats and wax than American chocolate. I would rather have this than Godiva. Great stuff!,5
More jerky that is made in China. Unknowing owners are feeding this potential killer to their loved pets. Please research dog treats you feed your pets before you end up heartbroken and with high vet bills.,1
so so so good that im never ever gonna buy any other cup noodle soup but NONG SHIM. best cup noodle soup i have ever had,5
"Ghirardelli makes the best brownie mix ever!<br />With real chocolate taste & richness like you made them from scrtach.<br /><br />We came across the Ghirardelli six pack at Costco.<br />Since then it's been a staple of our food pantry.<br />Our family agrees this is instant, ole' fashioned baking.<br /><br />When you make two packs at a time in a 9 x 13 pan<br />the brownies are thick and yummy, sometimes a little gooey.<br />For moist, but not gooey brownies, bake a little longer<br />or only bake one batch in a pan.<br /><br />We add extra pecans, and think that makes them even better.<br />This has been a big hit at family gatherings for the last several years.<br /><br />What more can you say about something that's easy and satisfying.<br />Ghirardelli makes high quality chocolate, and this is a high quality brownie.",5
Tried the Beta Sitosterol for a month and it had no effect whatsoever on nocturia. The claims are greatly exaggerated.,1
"This is a big disappointment.  Suddenly the formula changes - for the worse.  I have canceled my formerly wonderful ""Subscribe & Save"" Amazon subscription.  Might as well buy Cap'n Crunch or Frosted Flakes.  ""Now Tastes Even Better!"" the company says.  Well, it depends on who's doing the tasting! It is now far too sweet, as well as being significantly less healthy - look at the increase in calories and sodium.  What a pity.  Farewell, Special K Protein Plus, old style.  It was nice knowing and eating you.",1
"We all love it. I have a ""Man Cave"" in my basement with a popcorn machine. All my friends and family love the popcorn I pop. I now use nothing but Great Northern. I also have a small machine in the main area of our house and use nothing but Great Northern in it as well. Great taste, very tasteful seasonings, includes the seasonings and oil. We love it!",5
"This is the best tasting popcorn we've found for our stand popcorn popper.  We've tried a few others and this tastes the closest to movie theater type.  It pops well and tastes wonderful!  Works well on the stove top, in the counter stir-type popper and also in the popcorn cart type popper.  Highly recommend!  Glad we found it, plus the price is great!",5
This popcorn tastes just like the popcorn at the movies. It's easy and convenient to fix has just the right amount of salt.,5
"I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one.",3
"always great with shredded wheat or all by itself with almond milk. I buy several types, always Bobs ... quality reflects in the taste.",4
"If you like honey as much as I do, then you know that when you need a quick sweetness fix, you can just pop the top on the honey and have a taste. That's not so convenient when you're in the middle of Macy's, riding the subway, or suffering through a long, boring lecture. Honees to the rescue!<br /><br />What are Honees? I'm glad you asked. Honees are way at the top of my list of sweet rewards, the treats I have because I deserve them. They are little brick-shaped hard candies, golden in color, with a center of pure, liquid honey. The hard candy shell tastes like honey, but the payoff is when it melts, delivering that pleasing burst of sweetness. So delightful, they move me to poetry (I love Honees, yes I do; if you love honey, you'll love them, too. Okay, I get it, enough with the poetry).<br /><br />Honees are not available everywhere, but they are available to everyone in the forty-eight contiguous states through Amazon.com, my go-to source of hard-to-find groceries.  Manufactured in Italy by G. B. Ambrosoli, they are imported to the United States by Andre Prost, Inc.  Each luscious piece contains only twenty calories of unadulterated yumminess. There are nine individually wrapped pieces in each ""bar,"" twenty-four bars per box. Besides the allure of their flavor, Honees are a lot more manageable than a pot of honey in your pocket.",5
A healthy treat that is hard to find in stores.  I cant give my dog anything Chicken (allergic) and found the Sweet Potato glucosamine treats here on Amazon at a great price too. My Lab absolutely loves them and the glucosamine is good for his hips.,5
"These are fantastic - very hard to stick to the ""4 cookies"" serving size!  It's nice to have a treat that doesn't taste gluten-free!",5
My boys and I love these cookies!  These are some of my favorite gluten free cookies...I couldn't stop snitching them from my kids (they are the ones with Celiac).  The packaging makes them perfect for snacking.,5
"I actually bought these at a local natural/health food market. They were insanely expensive and I wish I would have tried amazon first! Still, I LOVE these cookies, I got the EXTREME chocolate mini cookies and they're delicious! Even my kids like them and they can be fairly picky. They're loving getting to try all of my ""new gluten-free things!"", and I may be moving them gluten-free as well.<br /><br />These cookies have a wonderful flavor, texture, and crunch. I find myself happy with just 2-4 of them, instead of just wanting to devour the entire package considering the small size of the cookies. Size wise they remind me of the chocolate chip cookies you can get in that mixed pack of grandma cookies? I think that's what they are, they have the frosted animal cookies, and those chocolate chip ones. Anyway, they're smaller cookies, good flavor, good crunch, gluten-free and great price here at amazon. What more can you really ask for anymore? ;)",5
"I was surprised how large the tub actually was. The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not ""ruin"" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again.",5
I use this as a body lotion as well as in lip balm that I make.  It is consistently a good product.,5
"I got this coconut oil for my baby's diaper rash because we use cloth diapers. I don't think it has been terribly effective for its intended purpose, as it doesn't really clear up the rash quickly. Also, it's very liquidy in even slightly warmer temperatures and tends to make a mess everywhere as it spreads upon contact with body heat.<br /><br />However, it smells very good, and I've used it in the kitchen for cooking as well.",3
"Me and the missus went through this pretty quick... It's sweet, peppery, tasty.<br /><br />This was enough to satisfy my craving for jerky for awhile... I think the sugar, salt, and MSG are the main turn-offs for me although I do realize some of this may be required for jerky.<br /><br />It's almost like I want either a more wholesome jerky snack or a straight-up rod of faux-meat.<br /><br />Still, this is worth checking out to see if it's your thing.",4
"Chocolate cherry kind bars are yummy, and one of the lower calorie kind bars. I order by subscribe and save and I had to increase the frequency.  A real treat - love em!<br />Reviews are misleading.  I can tell that a lot of the reviews are for other flavors of kind bars, not cherry chocolate.  No one would say they are peanutty!  They are chocolaty and chewy and cherry-ie and delightful.",5
"Tastes great and satisfies my hunger. I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no ""melty"" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up.",4
"i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .",1
"these are not fresh sour cherry. they are some kind of candy, hard, not even sour or sweet. why they call it ""harvest cherry sours"" only they know. very disappointed. I want it to return (pack of 8 ?? of candies) but I cannot because of the return policy for groceries.<br /><br />I will not recommend this product to anybody. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IMV6CI"">Hickory Harvest Cherry Sours, 14-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 8)</a>",1
"Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's ""satisfying"" and ""nutritious.""  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.",5

"Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want.",5
"Ive been on the hunt for a great caramel sauce for coffee. Lattes, frapps, etc., made here at home.  THIS is not for that. Odd taste (pure ingrediants) so its not that, I've had some amazing tasting pure ingredient caramels.My first thought was it had gone bad. My family doesnt think so. They too didn't care for the taste.<br /><br />Must  be refrigerated after opening which makes it a thick, unsqueezable mess. I imagine you have to spoon some into a dish and lightly microwave or use saucepan in order for it to have a ""sauce"" like consistency. Definitely NOT what I was looking for....whether for a coffee drink, or sauce on ice cream or cheesecake.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board ....",2
"My yorkie has severe alergies. He tears alot and is constantly scratching. We had him on Wellness Super5 for Small breeds but his condition didn't improve until we switched him to California Naturals rice and lamb small bites. He is tearing and scratching a lot less now and we only had him on the food for a week! I truly think it's the limited ingredients contained in his new food. Also, my yorkie is very very finicky but he inhales it like there's no tomorrow.",5

"This is like a fine cake batter. I think you need to have the correct type of recipes to use this product. To just subsitute this flour for regular cake flour made my cookies pretty flat. THere must be something either I am missing, or I need the right recipes to go with this type of flour. It is a great idea to make something gluten free...just needs more directions or recipes to go with it.",3
"I just received my order today.  As noted in other reviews, the K cups came in a stapled brown bag.  However, unlike the previous review, all the K cups were clean and undamaged.  None of them were expired, and the earliest expiration was in mid-August .... plenty of time for my family.  I was so pleased with the selection in my bag!  Here are the details:<br /><br />12 regular coffees<br />10 flavored coffees (including several limited edition flavors)<br />3 hot teas<br />3 cappuccinos<br />2 iced coffees<br />2 decafs<br />1 iced tea<br />1 cider<br />and 1 hot cocoa<br /><br />I love that I have the opportunity to try so many different brands and flavors.  If I am looking for a variety pack in the future, I will definitely order again!",4
If you love Balsamic Vinegar you will love this product.  It is Balsamic Vinegar on steroids.  It has a somewhat stronger and sweeter taste than regular balsamic vinegar and it is much thicker and clings to everything in your salad plate.,5

"I have to say that The Super Lemon Candy is the best hard candy around. It brings back memories of elementary school when I first ate this candy. I love it where the candy is a little sour at first and after a few seconds of sucking and licking it becomes nice and sweet with a strong lemony flavor. You must try them, there will be no regrets.",5
I love it for my dogs and my dogs are crazy about it. I have reviewed this product before. Please don't ask me to do it again,5

"I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a long heritage of discriminating taste. Pet'n Shape products are my most favored treats,and I am especially fond of Chik 'n Breast. They are pure chicken with no additives, and, as I am watching my figure, they break easily into smaller morsels, so I can exercise moderation in this delectable indulgence. Ten out of ten of my canine neighbors agree that this reward is well worth obeying a command or two. I give it five paws up.<br /><br />Sincerely, Phoebe",5
This product taste's ok but it's the texture that gets me. It had kind of a grainy texture. I looked at the ingredients and wheat flour is in the ingredients. Why they would put wheat flour in this licorice. I think that contributes to the odd texture. This is the only licorice I've ever eaten with this weird texture. My favorite licorice is Natural Vines strawberry or black licorice which they sell here on Amazon. It is all natural and has no preservatives and no weird texture.,3
"Unfortunately, Vegemite will not be a regular find in our home. The taste is quite unusual. It needs to be acquired and no one has any interest in acquiring it.",1
"This was a tasty product, but there were several negatives. When I received the package, it was all smashed up into a big mush; it was a tasty mush, but didn't look appetizing. I was very disappointed at how small the package was, especially with the high shipping cost.",3
"I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google ""Dogswell made in china"" and decide for yourself.",1
"Excellent price for an excellent product, esp w/o shipping charges. I am very pleased w/purchases from Amazon. Plus, their selection is great- lots of ORGANICS, too!",5
Tastes exactly like regular fatty creamy peanut butter!!! You would never guess its powder!  All the flavor and barely any calories!! I LOVE IT!!!!,5
"This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite ""natural"" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)",3
"In no way would I consider these k-cups having a bold flavor. In fact, I usually have to use two of them on the espresso setting to get any enjoyable flavor from them.  If I were you I would stick with the Donut Shop k-cup as it has a more natural coffee shop taste.",3
"I handed this tea over to my husband to drink, because he likes/consumes energy drinks a lot, and I figured he would have the best opinion on how well this tea lives up to it's name. To begin with, he was mildly impressed with the flavor. He generally likes vanilla flavor but did not seem to find this flavor to be anything remarkable. I thought it smelled pretty good when he brewed it. Reminded me of those glade plug-ins air fresheners. (Seriously!) As for the energy aspect of this tea, he said it did not affect him one bit. He drank it over several days and said he felt no difference in his energy level as a result of this tea. I was stunned by that, considering it packs 80mg of caffeine per cup! And he did not drink it watered down either! On the upside, though, he said it naturally tasted slightly sweet which he liked (no need to add sugar!), and the long list of the herbs in the tea are actually good for you, so that's a nice plus. Overall it's a good product but if you are looking for a marked energy boost, I believe this tea will not offer that. He never felt any side effects from it either, which is good. That being - no headaches, no stomach upset, no jitters, etc. It seems to be a high quality product. Maybe for people who do not regularly consume caffeine or energy drink products, this might work differently or better as an energy beverage. :)",3
"When in Boulder this summer I took a tour of the Celestial Seasonings factory.  Kind of boring.  Except for the enclosed room where they keep the various mint herbs.  It will clear your sinuses!  But I digress.  You do get to sample any tea they have and that is worth the trip.<br /><br />In any case, I love this tea.  I have always enjoyed the iced tea they serve at Thai restaurants.  Not the full version with the sweetened cream.  Just straight.  To me, this is very close.  I kind of wish it was caffeinated, but its nice to have something to drink at night.<br /><br />Coconut flavor?  If I had drank it not knowing what it was, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify such a flavor.  But something about this tea does have a very unique flavor, which I like.  And it is also absent vanilla, a flavor I dislike in teas.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  I have gone thru 6 boxes in a couple of months and re-ordered early via Amazon's subscription service and am pleased.",5
"This is going to be a staple in my house from now on- good flavor, less jitters, makes a great 'anytime' coffee. Decaf can be so uninspiring.<br /><br />I wish they would make flavored half caf....are you listening, Green Mountain..",5
"These are DELICIOUS! They remind me a lot of Wonka Jaw Breakers as far as taste, but they are soft and powdery instead of hard. I prefer them over conventional candy and while they are obviously a bit more expensive they are worth every penny and you don't get that nasty sugar rush then crash that you get with conventional candies. Enjoy!! They're great!",5
"This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.",4
"I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.",4
"Great product, one of my favorite candies.much better than the nerds I bought too. Too bad it has hydrogenated palm oils,they are bad for you.But it tastes so good I don't care.I am an adult by the way. I bought the watermelon bars with the candy seeds, loved it. I like grape and cherry too.",4
"This product is from Brazil, not the usa and doesn't taste that good! This is false advertisement from Native.<br />I will not be buying any more of their product!",1
I don't understand the difference that this pod has over other kcups that I could use to brew iced coffee since the only difference is that I brew it over ice.  I like the flavor of coffee so I didn't mind that there wasn't much difference.  I did have a huge problem with the kcups themselves though because every time I tried to brew coffee the top of the pod would come off and then I would get coffee everywhere and grinds would go everywhere.,2

"This is by far my favorite olive.  You can sometimes find them in grocery stores, but they are really not that common.  The flavor is mild and buttery...even olive haters should not mind eating these.  This particular olive is imported from Italy and is a bit saltier than the ones you find in the grocery store.  They are really good...if you've never tried them you should.",4
"What can I say? Instant ramen is a vice that's stuck with me since my college days. I love ramen and I can eat anything from the instant stuff to my favorite premium ramen in NYC at Ippudo. The spicy Shin Ramen is about as low as I'll go on the ramen ladder but for what it is, it's great. It's big, spicy, flavorful, and most importantly, it's cheap. Sure, there's higher quality instant ramen out there but none under $1 per bowl.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Flavorful<br />Delish<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bottom of the ramen ladder<br /><br />Bottom line: A cheap and delicious vice. Best when stressed, drunk, or in need of comfort.",4
"I'm sorry to say even the non diet syrup uses nutrasweet as a sweetener, sadly this makes for a poor taste. I use the original Coke cola Syrup but now having trouble finding it.<br />From the looks of it all SodaStream syrup has Nutrasweet so be warned if you don't enjoy the taste.",2
"Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.",3
"I have a VEEEEERRY fussy 2 year old Ragdoll cat who cannot eat dry food (it makes him throw up) and he hates most all canned foods.  (And I know, because I have tried them all!)  Thankfully, I found this food before he starved to death!!!  He really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he NEVER did that before!)  The food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little ""rectangle"" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy.  I am very happy with the ingredient list, and the fact that it is a high-quality, nutritious, premium food for my fussy boy!",5
"Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.",2
"The diet cola and diet lemon lime are great to me, but, sadly, I don't like the diet orange. I dearly love having the equivalent of so much weight (regular bottles and cans) in such a small bottle. I'm slowly trying the rest of the diet flavors and hope to find more I like.",5
"The package arrive with the seals broken, but in a plastic sealed bag, so kinda strange... there were 50 in there, and expires March 2013, so good that way too.<br />Tried it, its probably the best instant coffee I have tasted... BUT to those who think it tastes like the store coffee at Starbucks (which I do like very much), I am not understanding what those people are drinking...<br />If I rated it against other instant coffe, it 4.5 stars, if I rated it against Starbucks coffee at the store, its a 2 star. So I gave it 3 based on vs. other coffee, but being more expensive.  its maybe about as good as a Kurig coffee or passable, for comparison.  That being said, I like great coffee... most coffee at the supermarket is is swill.",3
"VIA Italian Roast tastes burnt.  Since its a new product, Starbucks take notice: the 50pc half-filled non-descript recycled box packaging it comes in is really lame; It came crushed in the order. Moreover, the packets do not tear fully at the perforated line.<br /><br />Instead, try the VIA Colombia and VIA Mocha flavors. The packaging is the same but the flavor is rich and smooth and tastes brewed.",2
I was looking forward to giving this to my husband who loves anything Jerky but this was a big dissappointment. Very Hard! I would not recommend this particular Jerky. It was a waste of money,1
These cookies are sooooooo good! I discovered them on a flight from Europe and immediately ordered them as soon as I got home. You'll have to lock the top to keep yourself from eating them one after the other!,5
"Throw a few in your diaper bag in case of emergency and you don't have to worry about space issues or worry about trying to measure out formula in preparation for a long outing.  Like others, I use this to supplement so this is also fabulous for those onesie/twosie feedings that come up when I can't nurse - without having to buy a can of powder.  I got hooked on these when they sent me samples in the mail.",5
These anchovies are meaty fillets of beautiful fish. I have been using these for years and they are always excellent.,5
Regardless as to how good or bad the food items are I don't consider this to be a 'gift box' as a 4x7 inch non-removable shipping label was slapped on top of the box. As I was giving this to a friend for Christmas I attempted to remove the label. The holiday box design came up in strips along with the label. As one pays a premium for these food samples one does so because they are arranged and displayed attractively and come in a 'gift box' to be given as gifts.,2
"This is a lot of nuts, particularly for the price.  I toast them myself and save a bundle over grocery store prices.  Definitely would purchase again, if I ever run out!",5
"I bought these when Amazon ran out of the Senseo pods; the coffee comes out rather weak. They work a little better if you use 2 at a time, but that defeats the cost effectiveness of buying these, and you can't really triple-up for a taller cup. Also, they are individually wrapped, which I guess is better for ""fresher"" tasting coffee, but we drink so much coffee it just seems like a waste of packaging.",2
"I was at a friend's house recently and she was trying to impress me (that is another story) and she used this product with the meal she was serving, which included a wonderful beef dish.  She also used it with a cheese spread she invented herself.  This stuff is absolutely delicious...I was absolutely stunned.  I know food and I know good food and this stuff is great.  It also allowed my friend to get what she wanted.  I plan to order this stuff myself.",5
"Hard to find a better crispy sugar-free cookie and, believe me, I've looked.  Good price, good storage.",5
I use this sweetener in my coffee.  Friends told me they thought it had an aftertaste but I really didn't notice it.  (I smoke... maybe that's why)<br /><br />Not sure about the 140 servings but you don't need much and I've had it for a while and still have some left.<br /><br />The container is great.  An opening for a spoon on one side and an opening for pouring on the other.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF,4
"I bought these beans with the idea that I would start roasting my own beans while searching for the perfect cup of coffee, both in taste and economy. I roasted one pound of beans on the stove with a Whirley-pop popcorn maker, from start of heat to finish this method took about 20 minutes to produce a dark-dark roast. As an amateur, I'm only guessing that it was good enough to be an Italian roast. (Note: This is darker than recommended light-French roast.) Once cooled and ground this brewed a fine cup of coffee. I am not well versed enough yet to completely characterize the roast, but I drink a lot of coffees.<br /><br />A 5 pound bag wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but then I had forgotten about water weight. I weighed pre and post roast and found that my one pound was reduced to 11.5 ounces.<br /><br />The beans in the bag seem fine. I haven't run into any ""ugly"" beans, or foreign objects, the beans themselves kind of resemble soy nuts in size and color. They have a sort of alfalfa pellet smell, which I kind of like. The only thing I was kind of disappointed with is the product labeling. I was hoping to see more information about the origin and dates harvested and packaged. There was a sticker with the number 22012, which I can only assume is the date the bag was filled.<br /><br />I have found less expensive beans on the internet from other suppliers, but for the convenience of Amazon, and free two day shipping with Prime, it's a pretty good deal. Through the suppliers website you can get the beans for about 7 bucks less, but then I'm sure you will make that up even with slower ground shipping.<br /><br />All in all a good deal for a fun and rewarding activity.<br /><br />(Additional note: I recommend roasting outside or in the garage. My house was filled with smoke, and it scared the dog so much she peed on the floor.)",4
"I love the coffee, the price is great, but the product I received was not what was advertised.  In the 4 variety boxes there were NO Kona coffees.  The substitute was the Breakfast Blend.  This is not what I ordered.  I am very disappointed.",2
"We were introduced to O.T.C. wine crackers while vacationing in Door County WI.  Found them very yummy, especially when wine tasting.  Come home and ordered a case.",5
These were easy to prepare and tasted like fresh scrambled eggs. I would recommend these to any one thinking of buying them.,4
Best Keurig decafe I have tasted--- and I'm pickey.  so is my son who only drinks Peets and he also liked it.,5
I found these nougat bars while visiting in West Palm but could not find them anywhere around where I live.  This was an excellent way to buy this excellent tasting bars!!,5
For the most part this is a good crunchy snack but beware of the small orange ones.  They taste a little funky!,3
"I have used the Minor's chicken base for years. I always purchased it from BJ's wholesale. When we moved I panicked, there were no BJ's close enough to us. When I Googled Minor's and found I could purchase it on Amazon I was thrilled. I use it for everything from clam sauce to turkey gravy. I don't care what i have to pay for it. I will not be without it. The beef is a must for roast gravy and stews. It beats any other meat flavoring out there.",5
"Very Happy to have finally found Bob's ""Big Jim"" Giant Peppermint Stick, 5 oz.) on Amazon.  This Old Fashioned candy is impossible to find in local (Oregon) stores whereas it was once a commonly found candy particularly for Christmas stocking stuffers.  I wanted these for two grandchildren to share a treat from my childhood and was very happy to find them on Amazon.  Shipper was very prompt and the candy sticks arrived in Germany before Christmas.  The children were so surprised and excited to find these Giant Peppermint Sticks.  Will definitely order again.",5
"Before I bought this (there was a great promo at the time, $20 off 2nd 5 lb bag and free shipping)I read reviews saying how great it was, but now the reviews are gone... very weird! So anyways, I have a Cuisinart Grind and Brew, I have had one for 7+ years before they even had the carafe version.  The only weird thing about this coffee is that it leaves little ""rocks"" behind in the grinder (and this is a newer cuisinart grind and brew). All other brands, xxxbucks, etc doesn't do that. But the flavor is great, we like ours strong but without that dirt flavor like some of the xxxbucks cofee has so this is great for us!",5
"I switched my cats to this food about a month ago, and while their coats are definitely nice and soft, they seem to fart uncontrollably now. Several times a day, both our cats will cut these wretched farts that make you want to throw up. I think we'll be switching them to something else next time.",3
"I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!",5
"The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money.",3
"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead.",3
"This is the best. My local store stopped carrying it, so I now get it here, and am happy I can. It spoiled me for anything else.",5
"I've tried many brands - powders and liquids - but this is the purest and best tasting. I now have iced or hot tea and this is the sweetness calories - zero - I can afford.<br /><br />But you can use too much tastewise so be careful in the beginning.<br /><br />Also, personally I do not like the taste if I am drinking a beverage with milk such as coffee.",5
Yummo!  Just made these into cupcakes and made a powdered sugar/crisco based icing.  All of us ate them and loved them.  As good as any other boxed cake we've had.  I didn't pay attention to the directions very well and just dumped it all in and turned my electric stand mixer on and it baked up without any issue.<br /><br />We've been trying to stay away from gluten and sugar but got this in a sample pack so decided to go for it.  So glad we did.  What a treat!,5
"First I'll say that if you are not used to taste of buckwheat, the cereal may be one of those ""acquired taste"" things. For me, there is an aftertaste only for the first few bites and then I don't taste it anymore. I find it to be a really good gluten-free cereal. And it's not dry and chalky like some. It's very crispy, but I'm one of those people who can have no to very little milk in cereal so maybe I'm not a good judge. My kids eat it with plenty of milk, though, and love it. The recipe for trail mix on the back is really good. I make it with half of the recommended amount of honey and use agave nectar for the other half.",4
"I always considered ocean spray cranberries to be the best but I decided to try these to save some money.  I was really pleased to see that the flavor was just as good as the more popular and more expensive brand.  Since they are dried, they last a good long time.  I eat a handful at a time and it stops the hunger and is healty.",4
"(ASIN: B0012KB4X4) All of the wild salmon entrees are terrific.  Cotton simply doesn't like the taste of 'wild,' if there is one.  I think that, in this case, it means stronger flavor.  (He doesn't like herring, sardines, or  sometimes mackerel, either.)  So it is his loss; the gain goes to those other cats out there with more advanced palettes.<br />Cottie is a one-year old, for all intents and purposes still a kitten.  As a Jewish mother, I had hoped that with age, his taste buds would approve more foods, but as of now they haven't, so either first impressions have stuck with him, or he just doesn't like these flavors -- you know, the ones with aromas that curl your nose hair and really stink up the room the minute the lid is removed.  Periodically,  I try to give him Fancy Feast Wild Salmon Florentine, but he so far proves to me the immovable object.  (I have also tried the Fancy Feast Wild Salmon Tuscany (ASIN: B0012KH0LE) and Primavera (ASIN: B001STX0ZO),all purchased from Amazon.<br />I did try fooling him, once, and I am the one who got the short end on that one.  He loves Fancy Feast tuna with cheese.  I mixed some of that into the wild salmon.  Which not only did not do the trick, but Cotton refused to eat that favorite for a very long while, suspecting that I was trying to trick him again.  It is really strange when you see your cat eyeballing his dinner in any strange way; this one took the cake!<br />Just don't let his intractability ruin your cat's chance to enjoy something special.",5
"I received the order as promised.  The size is a bit overwhelming for me; also I haven't tried it yet to test the authenticity.  I normally get a 8oz bottle from a discount store for $12.99, and thought this was a great deal.  Should last me for years!",3
"For lovers of spicy food, this is an excellent replacement for salt (not an addition to it). It's better suited for cooking than sprinkling on prepared food, or the yummy but not that hot on the tongue taste may be contradicted by an annoying tickle at the back of your throat. I discovered this eating it on popcorn, and I like food so hot no one I know can tolerate it. In fact, I bought this spice(a case of it) after reading a review that described it as insufferably hot. It wasn't that way for me, at least on the tongue, yet it was yummy. I'm not sorry I bought it. It's salt heavy, so people who like salty but hot food will love it as a salt replacement.Use it for cooking, not to sprinkle.",4
"At first I was skeptical. When a friend informed me that there were different grades of vanilla beans and that Madagascar grade A-1 vanilla beans were the best, I thought is it really that different?  Vanilla is vanilla right?  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These Bourbon vanilla beans are flavorful, fresh, and vital.  I ""tested"" them in a tapioca vanilla pudding recipe for which I had previously used vanilla extract and the difference was night and day.  I am now pulling out recipes for vanilla honey, vanilla maple syrup, vanilla coffee drinks, vanilla bean cheesecake, and more.  I was amazed at the uses of these beans also.  This product is highly recommended.",5
I like this product a lot.  Good healthy snack when you don't have fresh fruit handy.  Great flavor and satisfying crunchy texture.  My Dad loves them too.,5
I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a New Mexican living elsewhere who loves red and green chile. What I got was something that was probably a delicious product but it was PAST the expiration date listed on the jar. I contacted them and never heard back. It was like they took my $30+ and didn't give a flying fig what I got for it. VERY disappointing. If they had done right by me I probably would have ordered regularly. I do not recommend this company. They do not appear to be honest or care about quality or customer service.,1
My Mother became a fan of this juice while living in Hawaii. Now that she lives on the mainland again it was great to find this on Amazon. I can keep her well supplied without a tedious trip to the grocery store and then the post office. Thank you Amazon.,4
I was so looking forward to trying Rice Krispies.... I can buy a better product from a local store that tastes the way I want when I make the marshmallow treats.,1
"I'm under the weather and the ""green"" sections of my local grocery stores (yes stores) were ALL out of the vegan soup I like.  So I chose to try this particular soup for its lower calories, vegan fair, ingredient list and o.k. sodium content.  I followed the stove top directions only adding a smidge of the oil packet and cooking for about 1.5 minutes instead of 3.  (I've had problems with rice noodles in the past and I didn't want to eat slimy noodles).  I couldn't believe HOW GOOD this was-especially for the price point.  I had bought 4 soups total to make up for the one I couldn't get and I wanted to make sure that if any were gross I could have others to fall back on.  Oddly, this was my first choice and I didn't need to try another.  How grateful I was to find this soup.  I will continue to buy it AND encourage others to do the same.",5
Now only if I could get the Saag Paneer and Naan to go with it...,5
I thought giving chocolate bears would be great for the holidays but when they arrived half of the bears arrived broken or melted. The packaging was totally insufficient with only a plastic top on the bears. The candy was obviously not lovingly cared for and havoc reigned. Now I have nothing to give the kids. I would not order from this company again.,1
"I have tried many snack and nutritional bars, and these are my current favorite. The combination of flavors not only satisfies my hunger but also satisfies my desire for something sweet. What turns me off about most fruit/nut bars is the syrupy sweet substance that holds the ingredients together. I don't taste that at all in any of the Kind bars. I have this particular variety on auto delivery.",5
"These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day. They are my favorite breakfast bar right now, and for those who do like cranberries, you will love these.",5
"I like this bar, the mango flavor is really strong and it just tastes awesome. I purchased this from Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and will keep it for regular delivery.",5
"The taste of nougat and peanuts is overwhelming in this bar.  If you would like a ""healthier"" version of a Baby Ruth candy bar, this is it.",2
Packing was not appropriate. The cardboard box was torn in several places. Cans were dented. One can had broken and leaked over at least 4 other cans causing a smelly mess. It was quite unpleasant.,2
"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks,",4
"I love hot coffee with milk or half-and-half in the morning, and I try to avoid the sweetened foufou drinks. This Cappuccino in a can was too sweet for me. So, I added hot frothed milk to warm it up and it was much better. Not something I would drink straight out of a can. But, with a little tweaking, it's pretty good as an afternoon or evening treat.",3
"I had a yerba mate gourd in college and remembered how much energy and clarity it gave me, so 25 years later, I thought I could use some energy and clarity in my life, and ordered the Guayaki Chocolate Mate Tea.  It is very yummy!  It really taste great!  But not sure if it gives me a ton of energy or clarity - Not what I remembered from college, but then again I am a lot older, so maybe energy and clarity are not as intense as they were 25 years ago - lol.  Worth buying even if it is just for a yummy morning tea",5
A friend of mine from Columbia brought me back some last time she visited her mother and I got hooked. This is the only coffee I have found I don't have to dump a bunch of cream and sugar in to like. I have been conservative with it afraid I couldn't get any more. I am so glad to have found it here,5
"Wonderful, delicious stuff.  Add to ice water for total refreshment.  Or create a cocktail.

Add ice.  Top with a maraschino cherry.  Fill to top with club soda.  Stir again.<br />Go out in your garden and enjoy the Four O'Clocks.",5
"I love potato soup and favored canned potato soup.  Then my wife discovered this product and we tried it.  First, it's spicier than it needs be, if at all.  Second, it's not a creamy product because there are too many small potato pieces that never cook to a softer texture.  Third, looking at the ingredients list one can see that a potato taste is the end result of all of those ingredients.  Almost every product is far from what is claimed, it's something we gotta live with.<br /><br />However, we came up with a method for making better-tasting potato soup than just following their simple direction of only adding water.  What you should do first before beginning cooking is to sift the envelope mixture so that you wind up with just powder.  Then process the potato pieces into a powder and mix the 2 powders.  This will produce a creamy soup.  But if you just cook the sifted powder the soup will be creamier.  You can also cook the envelope contents without sifting and when the soup is cooked, use an immersion blender to further cream it up.  You can also sift the cooked soup and keep the cooked potato pieces for future use.  We use them when we bake potatoes and mash them.  We also mash the cooked potato pieces and mix them with the mashed potatoes which will result in slightly spicy mashed potatoes.",3
"This should be called mush in a can. Why is the low sodium version so unrecognizable, grainy and mushy without the chunk qualities you expect when opening canned chicken.  I need low sodium fast lunch solutions and was hoping this would help. What a rip off, it looks like they canned the leftover dredges from their premium breast of chicken and slapped a low sodium label on it. Shame on you Hormel!!",1
"This is the most delicious popcorn ever! While I was very glad to find out you could order it online, friends used to bring it back from Hawaii for me, it is pretty expensive when you realize you're only getting two batches of it. Worth it but I won't be purchasing frequently that's for sure.",4
"I ordered Mrs. Weiss' Kluski noodles, and got a whole box of New Mills Kluski Noodles, the picture in the order looks right, and it says New Mill by Mrs. Weiss in the picture but what I have is totally different.  The noodles are thinner than what I have purchased before, and the company should at least get the picture right.  Grr, I hope they are good because I am stuck with 12 packages of what I DID NOT ORDER, and I cannot return.",1
"This is my favorite green tea extract, they are all pretty good but this one seems to have the most active chemicals for the dollar.<br /><br />There is a comment about nausea, try to take this with food because I too experienced nausea when taking it on an empty stomach, with food it was fine.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but remember to tell your doctor you are taking this. Remember that chemically speaking this is no different than any other prescription or non-prescription drug you might take in terms of it having both benefits and side effects. Even the benefits can be side effects when combined with certain medications. That said, this is particularly safe, but still you must mention it to your doctor.",5
"One of my favourite chocolate in China, however, I can't find it in local store so I find it on amazon! Although there is a one-star review that leads to my hesitation for a while, I ordered this when there is no shipping fees and the taste is exactly the same. Maybe I will order this again later.",5
"I have numerous food allergies and got these as a healthy ""on the go"" snack. Unfortunately, I think the only way I would be able to enjoy them is cooked or baked in something since I don't like their taste ""au natural."" They are also extremely small and kind of hard to eat because when you put some in your hand, they roll all over the place!",1
"When it read ""original"" I thought these marshmallows would be like the ones you bought before they came out with ""jet puffed"". These are no different at all and just like the ones at a supermarket, ""jet puffed"".",2

"I purchased this because Milkman is no longer available (sigh), for bqckpacking and daily use as on dry cereal or oatmeal. I first tried Klim, apparently Nestle's companion product, which was pretty good. I don't like Nido as well as Klim. Plus the Nido was packaged in those detestable styrofoam peanuts, ugh. Going back to Klim.",3
"I might actually buy it if it had those. But seriously folks, just find a Sweet Factory in a mall and you can get 90% of this stuff for 90% less money. They're just trying to sell you on the 80's nostalgia title.",1
"I drink at least 1 sugar free rockstar a day, but not for anywhere near this price. I purchased mine at CosCo for 28.99 for the same size of a case. That is less than half the price for those who don't like math :)",3
Grapeseed oil is good for the body in so many ways. I found this product to be of excellent quality. It is also great for hair skin and nails. No scent.<br />This is my second order. I will defiantly be reordering.,5
I love almond milk and I always buy the unsweetend variety.  I've tried almond dream twice and both my husband and I dislike it.  We couldn't even finish the carton and I had to call the company to complain about the product so I could get my money back! It taste like they simply added almond flavor (like what you bake with) to water and then are selling it as almond milk!  I recomend you buy almond breeze or Pacific organic almond milk which both taste amazing!,1
When it arrived in the huge shipping box I had no idea what to expect but after digging through the packaging  I discovered the the plant was in very good shape. I am amazed at the habits of this plant. It is already growing beautifully after only one month in its new habitat. It is quite fascinating to observe and requires so little but offers great rewards.I love it-- it was worth every penny!,5
"Fantastic, juicy and tender!<br />Everything was great...is great (there is only the 2 of us) but next time I may even order with the desserts included.",5
"When I could no longer find Spam spread in ANY local store, I checked online to see if they had discontinued it.  Nope, supposedly still available.  Much to my surprise, Amazon carried it and offered free shipping making the cost close to the old store price.  What a convenience to have groceries shipped right to the door!  We are not big fans of the solid Spam but dearly love the Spam Spread and I will reorder it soon so as to never run out again!",5
"I was very hopeful based on the other reviews.  Alas, I found that it didn't taste very much like coffee at all.",2
"First and foremost, let me make it clear that this item was received free to test and review through Amazon Vine Voice in May.  I have no idea how long ago this was packed together.  Nothing appears to be stale.<br /><br />The packaging was a plain cardboard box with a thin cardboard insert that takes up the length & width of the box, in an attempt to make it look like there's a wrapped Christmas package inside.  The whole thing was nicely protected for shipping.<br /><br />I've never had Cheese Straws before and wasn't sure what to expect.  They seem to be a cross between a thick cracker and a cookie.  These are Aged Cheddar by Sonoma Cheese.  The taste is pretty strong and be prepared for a hot feeling in your mouth afterward.  The package contains 2 servings.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers contains 4 servings that have the pepper visible on the crackers.  A thin, dry cracker that has a mild taste.<br /><br />Sonoma Jacks Parmesan Peppercorn gourmet cheese wedges have 6 individually wrapped wedges.  The main ingredients listed are Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese.  A somewhat plastic/rubbery texture, although the taste is okay; nothing special.  A small cheese knife/spreader is included.<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies are bite-sized with 2 servings.  The cookies appear to have a somewhat breaded coating on them that poured out of the package as crumbs.  The cookies themselves were intact and I liked the taste.<br /><br />Brown & Haley Cashew Roca.  These were really good and are doubly wrapped for freshness.  Too bad there are only 3 in the package.<br /><br />Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt.  I generally eat plain almonds so I was happy to find that the salt is very light and added just enough to make these more interesting.  3 servings per package.<br /><br />1 sleeve of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I'm saving this for later.<br /><br />2 Ghirardelli Chocolate squares with Caramel filling.  It's Ghirardelli.  Enough said.<br /><br />1 Napa Valley Mustard Co Hot Sweet Mustard.  Label claims it's rich with honey; the main ingredient is sugar but honey is listed in there as well.  I really don't understand why this was included in the box.  There isn't anything to try it out on so this hasn't been tasted yet.<br /><br />As of this writing the price appears to be $39.99.  I just can't see myself purchasing this as a gift at that price.",3
"Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far.",5
"i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!",5
"The taste is all right, consistency thicker than supermarket honey. Bought it for assistance with my rabid GERD, alas, so far no progress with this or the other health irritations I hope to at least somewhat get a relief from. Nonetheless, one lives on hope and I already ordered a second jar just to give it a real try. I take a heaping teaspoon in the morning on empty stomach, and one or two follow ups during the day or at night before sleep. But as I've already said, no relief yet, have not been able to go without Zantac even though I've added two additional natural remedies against vicious heartburn.<br />The honey is expensive, and that the jar is plastic, disturbs me. For the price they could have used glass!",4
I bought this sauce hoping to recreate a local Thai restaurant's dish. Taste is pretty good but I kind of assumed the package was sauce only. It contains potatoes which almost makes it little more than a single serving. I would have preferred just sauce to add my own local potatoes.,3
"I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as ""Acai Tea"" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.",3
"I have previously tried the Whole Grain style of pasta from a box and thought it was very nasty, but thought that I would give this one a try as I had hoped it had improved over time (not same brand) and was a healty choice.<br /><br />After slightly opening the plastic cover/wrap, to allow venting, you place it in the microwave to cook for 60 seconds.  After removing it, the plastic cover/wrap seems to be stuck a bit firmly to the container, so removal of it should be done carefully or you will spill your sauce.  There is a separate removable mini sauce tray inside of the larger pasta tray that allows you to pour the sauce on your pasta.<br /><br />The sauce tastes just like the normal Barilla sauce (not my normal brand) and the pasta was cooked just about right.<br /><br />If I had not known that this was Whole Grain pasta, then I might not have noticed the slight Whole Grain flavor of the pasta.  It really is not that noticeable and was not bad for what it was.<br /><br />If the price was right, I might have this again in the future.  Would be good for less than 2 bucks, but under three would work too.<br /><br />It is more likely to be used for a work or school lunch, as the portion size was not a ""meal"" for someone like myself.",4
"Love these - perfection would be if it made no mess. They're delicious, just 'crumby'. They break apart into tiny pieces when you take a bite, can stain clothes if you don't know the crumbs are there.<br />Eat on the go with caution :-)",4
These moth traps really work.  I had a serious infestation of clothes moths in my apartment when I took my grandmother wool coat out of my closet and released a bunch of moths accidentally.  These few moths bred and then I had a moth problem. I didn't think I could get rid of them.  You have to give the product some time to work.  I set out 7 traps in my apartment.  I saw moths being caught little by little over a period of a few weeks.  I probably caught 60+ moths in these traps.  I think I finally have my apartment back under control with the help of these traps and extensive vacuuming and cleaning.,5
"Our family has liked every other flavored we have tried (BBQ is the best). We like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips.  I was wrong, no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips.<br /><br />I highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity.",1
"I have been a lifelong licorice lover.  Recently a friend sent me a six-pack of these licorice cats, which she said have become her favorite. She says she likes the slightly saltier taste than you find in most licorice candy. I was used to the soft and sweet Australian style, so it was a bit of a switch, but I really am enjoying this stuff. I've opened my fourth package now and would say that the chewiness is the only drawback for me. I have TMJ disorder and when I do too much chewing on this candy I end up with a sore jaw, but chewing brings out the great flavor, so I live with it. I would recommend this candy to licorice lovers without jaw problems.",4
"I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.",3
"It's been two weeks since I began bulk aging this Barolo kit and I am impressed so far.  The wine, even at this early stage is very drinkable, and has a beautiful, deep red color.  My only regret is having stabilized it before doing a malolactic fermentation, but I will do that on the next one.<br /><br />I took reviewer Duane's advice and used BM 4X4 yeast which I was able to buy in 30 gram packages from Fermentation Solutions in Campbell, Ca.  I also made this kit to 5.5 gallons and added 1 1/2 lbs of Zante currants (available on Amazon) for body.<br /><br />Though I have two much more expensive Winexpert kits going, I expect I'll be drinking this Barolo as my table wine while the other more expensive kits age.  You won't go wrong buying this kit, and with a few tweaks you'll have a very nice table wine for under 2 bucks a bottle.",5

"The name and packaging is what attracted me to it.<br /><br />The smell lured me in; I could sit forever in a coffee shop that smells like it.<br /><br />The struggle to open the outer wrap was frustrating.<br /><br />The brew itself, no matter how it's prepared is ok to good. It's not strong like Starbucks, nor mellow and smooth like Dunkin's. It is mild with no aftertaste. I am a long time coffee lover and drink it black.<br /><br />The choice is sustainably grown organic coffee or taste?  I'm going to mix it up!",3
"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much.",3
"I didn't have high hopes when I got this, but was very pleasantly surprised.  It's not a strong coffee, but it does have fantastic flavor.  I am definitely getting this again.",5

"This is a very healthy breakfast food and well balanced, for me it need a little more sweetness to it, so i add a little honey or cutt up banana. But its great. Takes a little longer to cook because of the sun flower seeds not as quick as the instant oats, but it is healthier and has more nutritious things in it. IN all i would recommend this as a good healthy breakfast to start your day.",4
"I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.",1
"When my grandson was born, Diogenes was able to retire and seek the sleep he so deserved after searching so many centuries for an honest man. My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34"">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  ""It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!"" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  ""Let me show you.""<br /><br />I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the ""salt"" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between ""regular"" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!  This is another example of when a low price is not a bargain!",1
"For 20 bucks, it really urked me that the jar only slightly more than half full.<br /><br />I decided to give this a try, I orginally used ""just barley"" brand and thought I might try this one since there were other greens invovled.<br /><br />While it goes down easier than ""Just Barley""  I didnt feel that small kick in energy im used to..<br /> its only been a day, so I will gave it a day or two more.<br /><br />Aside from that, Im trying to shake off the feeling of being ripped off with what was almost half a jar of powder.  Its bad enough that any attempt to try and eat healthy is abused with prices like these, The least they can do is fill up the jar with the stuff.<br /><br />If I end up liking it and getting another jar of it Ill raise the score, provided I dont get half a jar again.",1

"When my son was first diagnosed with a nut allergy we stopped using any kind of nuts in the house at all.  Peanut butter being my favorite thing this was a major blow to me.  People told us to try soy-nut butter or whatever.  YUCK.  We saw SunButter initially at our local grocery store and bought it.  BLISS.  Peanut butter lovers REJOICE.  We ate the SunButter natural for a few years which was fine but kind of runny and you need to mix it.  Just recently we bought this Creamy SunButter and folks let me tell you I am a believer.  You could literally pass this off as peanut butter to some un-expecting test subject.  Thank you SunButter for saving our lives.  [[And I mean that]]-- our little boy is precious, he eats this every day and loves it as well.",5
"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.",2

When people got back to me with information regarding the product white discoloration, sticking to the inside foil and hardness of the candies, OZBO refused to replace the product because I couldn't collect all from whom I had given the candy. I guess OZBO would have me open each separate Riesen candy and inspect, then rewrap them and package back up in the bag. GET REAL OZBO. I hope this review is helpful.",1

"We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver ""dust"" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this ""dust"" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.",5
These things are the best for long nights of last minute homework! Its so nice not having to get an upset stomach after drinking a whole pot of coffee. Instead one little bottle and im good for hours! I think this is the best product out there for energy.,5

"This is my second time ordering the ""bulk"" amount, because these biscuits have no match, and they are hard to find in stores. Packaging was MUCH better this time -- bubble wrapped and double boxed. I'm giving a lower rating, though, because I received these in early August, and the expiration date is already up this December. So I feel I've been sent old merchandise. I would expect at least a year for a processed and packaged food item like this, especially ordered in this quantity.

After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my ""stomach of steel"" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this.

Someone recently gave me a small grinder containing pink Himalayan rock salt crystals.  The difference in the taste it added to food prompted me to do some reading on the differences.  You can do your own reading and I'll just say that it opens up a whole new world of flavors.  When that small grinder neared being empty I set about to find some refill material.  The price of the product from this supplier made me suspicious of it's quality.  Happily though........it's as good as any I've found.  The packaging and shipping were both professional and I am quite pleased with the order and intend to be a repeat customer.,5
"I admit, I am picky when it comes to peaches. They have to be really fresh! And when we moved into our own home recently, the very first thing I did was plant a Sweet Georgia Peach tree. My favorite kind.<br /><br />Now, I have to warn you, these are NOT as wonderful as biting a peach still warm from the sun and fresh from the tree before you bring it in and wash it. The juice from these jelly beans don't run down your chin when you bite into them. BUT these are the best peach flavored candy I have met in a very long time. There are only a couple of these flavors I would consider buying a whole pound of in individual flavors. The first is the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007J6JY7S"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Lemon Jelly Beans</a> and the second is this one.<br /><br />While your taste buds may find others that are better, these are the two that hit the spot for me.<br /><br />I was originally given a complimentary sampler of all of the flavors (which I reviewed) but these beans are so unique that I wanted to share my opinion of them on some of the individual pages as well. These ate A+ Jelly Beans!",5
"A very good variety for kids who like ""plain"" foods. It's not too sweet but there's also not much flavor either. Smells like a honey bun right out of the package. I will finish the box but it's just too boring for me. My personal favorite is Raisins 'N Spice and now I can see why. I prefer a contrasting taste and texture in my oatmeal. But it might be good for adults who like the hard-to-find Honey Nut. Same great quality as usual from Quaker.",3

"Both cats love Halo's Liv a Littles Freeze Dried Chicken Breast. My youngest cat wanted nothing to do with these treats for a long time then one day changed her mind and now is the biggest fan in the house. I haven't tried the Beef or Salmon. Chicken is king around here.<br /><br />I reserve these for once in a while treats or to entice eating by sprinkling it atop newly introduced wet/raw foods. The Halo website says the chicken is made in a marinade broth of sodium phosphate, salt, and carrageenan before it's freeze dried. I trust Halo's practices but do wonder how much salt is used in the process and wish the amount was on the label.<br /><br />I also have a tube of Thrive Freeze Dried Chicken from a UK company that has been very popular at holistic pet retailers lately. Their claim is that it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing else. I can't garner any more information than that from the tube or the manufacturer website, but my cats go nuts for Thrive just like they do Halo.<br /><br />These are expensive little treats but the cool thing about them is they can be served as solid chunks or broken into dust like particles, or wet by adding a little water. I have to think that with so many cats out there who have lost teeth, this is probably a superior treat to have once in awhile.",4

"It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body. In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses.",5

"I had high hopes for this product.  Having spent a fair bit of time in Singapore & Malaysia I have come to love the regional cuisine.  Especially Beef Redang which if you have never had it is a very tasty (muslim) dry style curry.  It is a process to make at home - lots of ingredients and slow cooking to yield a savory curry of tender beef.  When prepared correctly it is a knockout dish.  When I saw this product and the great reviews I thought it might be a good way to make a quicker version when the mood strikes.  Having said that  I cannot recommend this to anyone who has had this great dish nor anyone who would like to try it for the first time.  The kit is easy enough - stir fry beef and then add spice paste, coconut milk powder and water.  Simmer until tender and then voila beef redang.  If only - the mix gave off a faintly chemical odor which i found disturbing and off putting.  Beef Redang usually (like many dishes of the region) has a funky (good) smell from the use of fermented shrimp paste or belachan. its strong but pleasant - this in no way smelled of that.  putting aside the off smell I tried the curry and found it to be not just mild but flavorless.  Maybe this was an issue with this batch but I could no way recommend this product to anyone.",1

I mixed with some off the shelf dry food.  No Joy!.  Finally ended dousing it with some chicken broth.  That got their attention.  Risk Reward decisions were quickly calculated and they ate.  Must do this now every time until the bag is gone.  $3.00/lb down the drain.",1
Satisfactory but not completely satisfying as some other tea growers' Assams are but priced reasonably.,3
"I have been using this flavor (Lobster base) for several years and continue to get raving compliments of the dishes I prepare using it. Specifically:  in the simplest context, just include an ample amount in the water when you are boiling fresh shrimp (it works best when shrimp is shelled and deveined first to allow the most surface area to absorb the flavors)<br />  Slightly more complex: I use it to flavor my Salmon Croquette recipe. It is a fairly standard recipe -- although I use only fresh salmon filets (precooked)never canned salmon.  Include this product in your mixture for fabulous flavor! (one note -- this product is already pretty salty, so wait until you have added this stock , then taste your mixture before adding any more salt)<br /><br /> Bon Apetit<br />William Edwards",5

"This (creamy bacon), in my opinion, is one of the best Walden Farms dressings. It is thick and has a good bacon taste. Another rater mentioned that if you like vinegar dressings, you will like this. I guess that's true, because I like to cut this dressing with organic apple cider vinegar and liquid zero calorie sweetener, which makes a nice sweet bacon vinaigrette dressing - that reduces my sodium intake. Even so, it just as much straight from the bottle. The only other flavor or dressing I like nearly as much is the Balsamic vinaigrette one. I thought this was Creamy Bacon dressing, so the review belongs with that flavor, not bacon ranch. Sorry!",5
"Wonderful to find a guilt-free pleasure like this product. To me there was NO aftertaste and it was just sweet enough without being overpowering.

I can't imagine needing 4 tablespoons to 1 cup of hot water as the label suggests, but then I rarely eat any chocolate or sugar at all. Anyway, this was a very pleasant surprise and a fun treat to indulge in. I'll be ordering more....",5
"if i could only have one condiment from now on it would be huy fong's sriracha. i would, and have tried to, dip everything i can think of into it. it's so good. it's addictively good. it makes everything better. i can't really add anything beyond what the other reviewers have said. i'm really happy when i go out somewhere and see this stuff already on the table..",5
"I have used this shampoo for two weeks now. I can't really say it is that great. It is supposed to be for a dry scalp, which I have. However, it seems to leave a film on my hair and a layer on my scalp no matter how much I try to rinse it out.<br /><br />The one thing I do love about it is the smell. It smells like coconuts. However, I would not buy this again for cleaning my hair. I will finish the bottle but after that, no more.<br /><br />I have been using it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> . The conditioner works well but not the shampoo.",3
"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time.",3
"When ever my husband and I go to PF Changs he always asks for this sauce - most of the time he has to tell them what the bottle looks like and were they keep it in the back.  So for his Birthday I bought him his very own bottle - he was THRILLED!  It adds a little ""kick"" to just about any dish and is great on sushi (so i'm told).",5
My husband loves this stuff & I was paying $4 an 8oz bag at my local supermarket.  I almost fell out of my chair when I saw it on sale here & in bulk.,5
"Tastes better than Starbucks and are better too (organic).  Starbucks beans also look very dry next to these.  I have an automatic espresso machine and love them.  And to top it off, they are cheaper!",5
"These breakfast cookies are like a bowl of oatmeal only more convenient to eat.  Running late, grab one and out the door.",5
"I LOVE Barney Butter! It is so smooth and the almond flavor is just exceptional. I have tried other almond butters and Barney Butter is by far my favorite. In addition to being delicious, it gives me energy and is also quite filling. As an added bonus the snack packaging is fantastic for a few reasons. I like it for myself because it is easy to transport and is only 90 calories so that helps me to monitor how many calories I am taking in.  I also love it because my kids have allergies to tree nuts and they love Barney Butter so much that they ask for it by name. Due to their allergies we have to be very careful about what they eat and therefore are always bringing food with us to restaurants, birthday parties etc. The snack packs are a Godsend because they are so easy to just grab and go. I highly recommend Barney Butter overall and especially like the snack packs.",5
I have been using these bars for about a year. Apparently they changed the formula 7 months ago and never disclosed the formula change. Lets face it when purchasing a product we do not re-read the calorie and ingredient list EACH time we purchase it UNLESS it says formula change or New or gives us some indication thre has been a change. Seems almost illegal to not say so on the lable front.<br /><br />So careful people. You could almost have a small meal now for the calories they contain.,3
"The flavors are great - especially Jalapeno and Honey Mustard.  They're not as good as real chips, but you can save a few calories and fat grams and they are WAY better than baked chips.",4
"Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.",5
My sister was the recipient of this bread and she was really happy with it. She loves it. I was happy to find bread on amazon since it's nearly impossible to mail food to people.,5
"Like other reviewers, I have a cat who would get sick often. I had her checked for issues, but she is otherwise healthy.<br /><br />So when a my new vet suggested a sensitive stomach food, such as this, I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />The difference is amazing. She still has an occasional hairball (this doesn't fix that issue...I didn't expect it to. And my fluffball has more fur than any other living creature, so I can handle a once-a-month hairball). But her near daily throwing up has stopped.",5
"I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty.",1
"The whole family enjoys this granola, both in yogurt and plain.  Really great, although a bit pricey.",5
"I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.",2
"Not sure what the ingrediants are but it seems like I recall a strong honey taste. I didn't care for this one. Not understanding why they don't have the Peach Tea available in the gallon jug, because that is the best one. The amazon price is outrageous! They must be figuring on a built-in shipping cost. You can buy this at Schneuks grocery store for $2.99/gal. and on sale it is 3 jugs for $8. If you want your store to carry it, give them the barcode.",1
Beaba will not start. Tried replacing the gasket that came with the product. Still no joy. also descaling mentions is also a huge problem. Not worth the price at all.,1
"Our family enjoyed the cinnamon roll flavor of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites.  The cinnamon flavor was a welcome change to the familiar Frosted Mini-Wheats, but I didn't care for the Little Bites size.  The smaller bites grew soggy in the milk faster than Frosted Mini-Wheats usually do.  However, the smaller bites were perfect for my younger children.  Everyone who taste-tested the Cinnamon Roll flavor in my house enjoyed it, but I still prefer the original Frosted Mini Wheats.",4
I love this diet soda.  I particularly love this flavor of black cherry. This brand is difficult to find and for a reasonable price.,4
My only complaint about using the Keurig machine is the Kcups are often not as strong a brew as I enjoy - since I've discovered Jet Fuel-no longer a complaint-excellent flavor & strong brew!,5
"I purchased this because I typically enjoy strong coffee and I wanted to give this a try.  I cannot drink this. It is bitter and almost chokes you. I have tried it several times, not wanting to waste the money I paid for a two pack, but have given up. There are many strong bold coffee K-cups out there that are quite good. But this is undrinkable.",1
These are terrific!!  Just pop in the freezer and you have a refreshing drink for anyone that drops by!  Love 'em!!!,5
"My daughter has Celiac, and these little cookies are a great alternative to gluten filled snacks, like ""Teddy Grahams"" that kids love! She likes them, especially with a glass of milk!",4
"I ordered this pack after reading reviews of many other products as well and happy to say I wasn't disappointed at all. I love white chocolate so naturally I loved that flavor the best. Although I don't like dark chocolate, that too was not bad! I mean I would drink it and like it even. I wish we could customize what we wanna have in the pack though. If so I would order most of it (if not all) to be white, being the white choc fan I am. But in no way that means other flavors are bad.<br />It is sweet and true to the label (no need to add anything else other than water).",5
All 3 cans were severly dented. Now I learned that I cannot return them. The cans were in a loose plastic bag in an unpadded box. Only a company completely unconcerned with customer satisfaction would ship heavy cans this way. I spent $26 on items that must be thrown away. DO NOT BUY from this vendor.,1
"Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...",3
"My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating.",3
We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?,5
"We've been feasting on Cope's Dried Corn for several decades now after we first tasted it in Pennsylvania Dutch country.  It is unbelievably good, especially in the creamed version (the last recipe on the back of the box).  Try it -- I guarantee you'll love it.",5
"Aside from the health dose of sulfite you're getting, the snack itself is alright.  The pieces are ok, the fruit are all frozen vegetable size, the mix is quite even.  The nut is sort of fresh.<br /><br />Everything is really middle of the road.  At the current subscribe-and-save price, it makes a good pantry item.",3
"What good is nutrition if your body is on the verge of puking? This is my first time eating Black Bean and Lime. I had tried Dr.McDougall's curry and Pad Thai; both are better tasting than this. BBL almost made me puke because of the taste, and some of the flavor blend didn't dissolve, rather it became a paste, a rather disgusting paste.",2
"My daughter loves these little pouches! She is not a big eater and it's been a struggle to get her to gain weight, but now (at 16 months old) she will suck one of these down in one gulp! We have to keep them hidden in the pantry otherwise this is all she would want to eat. We have tried the peach and banana Mish Mash flavors as well and she loves them all.",5
"The description seemed to contain favors I liked. However, when I got the shippment there were 6 k cups of flavors that I knowingly did not like. I would have not ordered this had I have known. They were the eggnog, gingerbread, and French toast from the Xmas season. They rest of the Krupa were good.",3
"Basically if you like almonds,chocolate and coconuts thrown together you will enjoy this product. Almond Joy's are a timeless classic.",5
"Ok so I'm deployed and thought I would buy something odd as far as beef jerky.. Out of all the guys in my Troop, only 1 person liked the jerky. Its not bad, but its not good..",2
"I was born and raised in cincinnati but have since moved to the west coast.  Its awesome that I can still get this stuff, it really brings me back to my childhood days.  excellent stuff!",5
These K Cups provided strong coffee without sediment in the bottom of the cup. I think the taste was deeper then the usual K cups and I felt better about not having the plastic on the bottom.,5
Our favorite coffee is Donut Shop by Coffee People and we were curious with this new type of Kcup. Although not the same as Donut Shop this coffee has a wonderful flavor. If you like a strong full bodied flavor use the middle setting otherwise the 10 ounce setting will still give you a very full bodied coffee without being watered down. All in all we will definitely be ordering this again. The best at .44 cents a cup this is a great value.,5
"this is a great cup of coffee for that first morning wake up jo, I do keep it in a lock and lock container and in the fridge and it stays very very well, will keep getting it delivered from amazon.",5
"They call this 100% juice, with no added sugar - the FIRST ingredient is Corn Syrup!  And now I cant return it.  Dont waste your time or money on this product.",1
"Since I love Thai food and there are no Thai restaurants in my area - AND I've had to go gluten free, which spurs me to investigate all sorts of new-to-me cuisine - I ordered this paste which incorporates the ingredients that are both hard to find here, and difficult to process. (Just TRY to get some galangal around rural parts of New England!)<br /><br />So then I had to learn how to use it. I think... I got it. To jazz up some already-cooked chicken tenders and millet, I used a teaspoon of this Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, maybe a quarter cup of coconut milk, fresh minced gingeroot (the kind available in US supermarkets) and a couple of teaspoons of ground cumin. Mixed all those together, added my chicken and millet, bopped it in the microwave, and wow, I thought I was transported to a good Thai restaurant in spite of the non-traditional millet in it. The red curry paste has the elusive ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, shrimp paste with Kaffir lime already mixed together so adding the other parts is simple. Wonderful taste, wonderful heat.<br /><br />BTW I carefully cut off one corner of the heavy plastic packaging so that I can squeeze out what I need easily. And it does say to refrigerate after opening, although I suspect the red chili would preserve most anything, including me.",5
"I ordered this for my sister's Xmas gift. I was shocked how quickly the order was fullfilled. Well, she loves olives so I already gave this to her. She loves it and wants more!",4
"I liked Gene Autry and Roy Rogers because they fought con-artist/swindler bankers, sheriffs, and land-grabbers (railroads, mining, Randolph Hearst). Profiteering parasites were exposed. High Fructose Corn Sweetener and GMO are two ways the profiteers ""care less"" about you, and what gets passed off as ""food"". Use organic sugar or you drink HFCS-tainted crap that passes itself off as ""old fashioned"".",1
"I love the highly portable nature of MIO and some flavors are good enough, but this one disappoints.  I love sweet tea, and I've had diet versions before, yet this somehow misses out.",3
"KRAFT has a slam-dunk - VERY close in taste a well known fast food place.  MiO is handy to have at work, or on a trip. I love the notion that one can control the strength of the flavor, with ease.<br /><br />I keep one in my desk,and one at home. Water just got an ""upgrade"".  Really nice!",5
"This is one of my favorite K-Cup coffee blends, am lucky Amazon sells it as all of my local stores are regularly sold out of this incredible coffee!<br /><br />I don't understand the negative reviews unless they're coming from competiting coffee brand salespeople!!<br /><br />I wish Amazon would add this coffee to their subscribe & save, but in the meantime am happy to get this delicious coffee at any price just to have it on my shelf :-)!!!",5
"These are great, but not real filling.  I end up hungry shortly after eating.",4
"Everything went as it was supposed to...mailing, packaging, condition of product!! We were very pleased!",5
I purchased this tea because we were headed into the mountains for vacation and I didnt want to get altitude sickness like I have on previous trips. I brewed the tea according to instructions I found on the web and added agave sweetner - Yum! What a pleasant beverage! The taste is very mild and sweet. I am a big tea and coffee drinker and I have been looking for an alternative to my morning coffee. This just might be what I was looking for......,5
"I have nothing but praise for Eden. They were one of the first organic food companies, and they've maintained their integrity in the face of a massive influx of ""corporate organic"" brands to the market.<br /><br />But they use kombu as a flavor enhancer in their beans and soy milks. And, while this really is a traditional Japanese method, it also means there will be naturally occurring MSG in the product. If, like me, you are very sensitive to MSG, it is likely you will have a bad reaction to these beans.",4
This product is not the same as the great tasting sour lemon.  It tastes like lemon hard candy with sugar in the middle.  The better tasting lemon is much lighter in color.  I ordered this product 3 times.  Returned the first two.  I'll keep this third order.  This darker yellow hard candy is no better than the $7 bucks for 7 lbs hard candy; no reason to pay $55,2
"This Easter special on Reeses will not last forever, and tastes the freshest right now. You will have a supply for weeks, and the awesome PB&chocolate treats arrived incredibly fresh. No melting, no problems. I ordered these two days ago with Prime, and I'm enjoying them tonight already about 10 in. Too good! Oh, and there at least 35 or 40 per bag. Great deal. Check out the Hershey's Easter candy, too! I stocked up for under twenty bucks!",5
I am so glad I bought these bars! They are absolutely delicious and a refreshing treat from all the other bars out there. I gave up on protein bars because I couldn't find one that tasted decent but these are really good. I've tried the peanut butter cream (awesome) and vanilla. Love the wafer taste.,5
I know from experience what I was ordering and was not disappointed in any way.  Shipped fast and arrived intact.,5
"This is the third 23 oz container of Tones Minced Garlic that we've ordered. It's simply fantastic, at a fantastic price. We add it to just about everything except our breakfast cereal. The taste is amazing. It re-hydrates quickly, so it can be added to anything from a can of soup to a baked dish. I sure recommend this product! And we'll be ordering more soon.",5
this coffee is just what i was looking for. my wife has gone through half a bag a day. excellent flavor not bitter not weak. ill never buy from the grocery store again. not the best ive had but the best ive made at home.,5
My purchase came in very poor condition and two of the bottles were defective. I am requested a replacement for the bottles Ihad bought and wait for response.,3
"There is no price too high to pay for such a miracle of taste and science. Get this. It is a cake IN A BOX.  Like is your mind blown? You just add water, shove it in the oven and CAKE. I'm not making it up. Powder. Water. Cake. Just like that. Like those sea monkeys, only less crunchy. And good? Man,I picked up a piece, took a bite and next thing I knew, I ate  my own hand.  That's real cake, I'm telling you, moist and rich. Okay, some of it was the hand, but even so. Go get some. You'll see. Only when you eat it, use a fork.",5
"One of my kitties has ear allergies, so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet. I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store. They rejected a majority of it and refused to eat it. They went nuts over this canned food, so I am now a huge fan. My pet store does not keep much in stock, so I was thrilled to find it on amazon!",5
"Cat loves it, and she's on a high protein, grain-free diet healing from cancer. She'd been extremely picky about eating anything other than feed mice or shrimp(expensive taste). Was giving her canned innova evo, but she seemed to tire of it and this is good quality and cheaper and she LOVES it.",5
"My dog LOVES these treats!! And I feel good about giving them to her because they are natural and healthy. Plus the glucosamine has eliminated her joint stiffness and the vitamins have increased her vitality. Buy these treats for your dogs, they will love you for it!",5
I use to chuckle when I read about busted tea bags until my last shipment. The 1st 48 count box I had 17 unsealed tea bags. Just opened the 2st box of the 48 count double box and found 8 out of 24 tea bags not sealed! And I still have another box of 24 to go. :( I to have chosen to cancel my subscription. I'm a poor country boy and cannot afford short changed boxes of Lipton Tea. I realize it is not Amazon's fault. They never bagged the tea. Oh well. Thank God for Walmart!<br /><br />I may give Amazon another chance with my tea order in 6 to 9 months. Maybe by then this poor shipment of unsealed tea bags will be gone. Going to miss the convenience of the gallon size tea bags.,2
"I originally found this in my local market about a year ago, tried it, loved it, then ... Like everyone else here has said, they stopped carrying it! I asked for it and they said they would look into it, but nothing yet.<br /><br />Luckily, I found it here, though it is $1.50 more a bag than my local Market Basket! That show's how much I love it; I bought five bags anyway!",5
"I buy a lot of Bear Creek soup mixes.  Although I work from home and enjoy cooking, especially soups and stews, I often relent to a mix.  Not necessarily for it is easier and faster, but sometimes I simply enjoy a taste other than by my own hand.  Bear Creek (BC) mixes are in my opinion the best of all the mixes I have tried.  (My favorite is the Bear Creek veggie beef).  The stock in all the BC mixes are the very richest that I have ever used.  They certainly don't skimp on the spices, nor the veggies and other ingredients included.  The minestrone is no exception.  It is a fine rich and flavorful soup that one will look forward to both making, and enjoying on a cold winter day.  Especially with a good hunk of crusty bread. (I prefer making mine in a crock pot.  A slower simmer seems to give it added flavor).  As with all the BC mixes, they all accept well your own personal additions to what is already included in the pouch.  I have added extra tomatoes, (stewed is best) extra onions, a little more garlic, (I'm a graduate of the never too much garlic school), and extra beef stock as another reviewer here suggested.  Sometimes all at once, and other times just an extra all by itself.  The pre mixed stock is so rich and delicious that its almost impossible to ruin it.  Bear Creek mixes are available in most larger supermarkets, as well as of course here on Amazon as well.  Although I have never ordered this soup mix specifically from Amazon, I have ordered many others, as well a variety of other food stuffs, and have never had anything taste ""cardboard"" or otherwise.  My only recommendation to you if ordering this soup mix or any other on Amazon is to make it worth your while as to the shipping and order several at once.  Try all the Bear Creek mixes, especially the veggie beef.  I think you and your family will find them pleasingly lip smacking...",5
"I am always on the prowl for great non-caffeinated teas for my afternoons.  I tried this one, and it's great!  Quite unique, and without adding sweetener, it's got enough fruity/flowery essense to satisfy me.  Apparently it's good for me too!",5
"I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.",2
"The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, ""original wild"" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous.  My mouth was burning for an hour afterwards.  This may be ""fun"" for some but not for me!  And I will give the ""mild"" a try - just to be fair).",3
"I used this product for years from Costco and it was great.  What I just received this bottle from Amazon and it is terrible, brown in color and gritty.Actually it is the second bottle I received as the threw the first one out thinking it was bad.",1
"The stigma of decafs, in general, has vanished! Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf is, by far, the richest and finest brew around. It is not ""almost"" coffee. It IS coffee, with more jazz and less BAM! Having to take medication at night I have found the perfect decaf companion. I have served it to many people who say it is the best coffee they have drunk. Sure, they were impressed by the Keuring machine... but the coffee stole the show. And the guests had no idea they were drinking decaf. It just doesn't get any better...",5
I ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea.  I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.,5
"after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be ""ginseng for women"" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to ""draw one's energy"" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's ""good for you"" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?",5
"This is the first time I splurged on full Kona coffee.  I have been curious on how good this coffee would be.  It is very good coffee but this will be he last time I buy it.  For the cost, it is not worth it.  Amazon sells some great coffee for half the price of this one.  If you have unlimited cash flow than go for it as it is good and very smooth.",3
"In store pricing is better. The raspberry is great I will try the other flavors. Publix or Walmart is probably a good place to start. .88 at Walmart. Buying in bulk online should be same price or cheaper, but it is double the price.",5
"I have to admit I was nervous to try a canned product but I was very pleased. The appearance is not great coming out of the can but when you mold it or mix it in with other foods it's just like ground beef. The taste is very subtle, almost nothing, which I think is a great benefit because it will absorb the flavor of whatever you cook with it. In general I'm very happy with this product and I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I have never seen it in a store!",5
"I reviewed the first flavor I got, the Raspberry Pomegranate a few weeks ago, and found it to be a product I could not recommend.<br /><br />This one however, the unflavored instant coconut water, is much better.  It almost tastes like normal coconut water and I will recommend this to friends.<br /><br />I don't know why they put dextrose in this, but alas, nothing is perfect.<br /><br />This other reviewer, he seems pretty gung ho on the pineapple flavor, so I'll try that one next, when it's available.",4
"I was impressed with the price of the tea and how quickly I received it.  I do agree with others that it has a very strong cinnamon flavor.  I expected that when I ordered it through reading the reviews.  I love to drink chai tea and while the flavor is definitely overwhelmingly cinnamon, I like it. It tastes like liquid red hots to me.  I am able to make very large cups of tea and still have the strong cinnamon flavor.  I am planning on ordering other versions of Davidson's chai teas to see if the flavor is any different.  I think it is a very good value.  If you are not a big fan of strong cinnamon flavor, try something else.",4
"Love this brand.  In fact, I've found it at TJ Maxx and bought several more bottles.  I like thicker balsamic vinegars and this one is just right.",5
I tried the blackberry Hint and loved it.  I hurried up and ordered 4 other flavors.  The first one I tried was the lime.  It really just tastes like soapy water.  I hope the rest aren't as disappointing.,1
"I use to grab my coffees at local stores, now do all my coffee shopping here, because of price and quanity, my wife loves the flavor of this coffee and swears by it. I bought the Kurig and have to say for time saving, and convience it's the best out there. It's also the only one that allows you to brew your on blends.<br />Also try Paul Newmans organic blend, that's my brew.",5
"Simply great! My son really Love his cereals, AND are Great for his allergies... Definitely a MUST for every mommy with allergic kids",5
"I love the subscribe and save with amazon, this came in properly packaged and just fine.  Creamy is good to spread on sandgwiches",5
"Skippy, consistently good.  I had been a Reese's Peanut Butter fan for years (still am), but the Skippy Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16.3-Ounce Jars is a decent buy and a very good product.<br /><br />The very first time I switched from Reese's and tried ""Peter Pan"",it just so happened to be when the contaminated batch was available. Result: I got violently ill. You know that saying ""If it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all"", well, at the time, that is how I felt. After that experience, I swore I'd only use Reese's peanut butter, but I tried the Skippy and have reordered twice since.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, very good quality and taste.",4
Awsome product.They are so good you can eat them in a bowl with a fork. Could be just a little hotter but very good.,5
Great price for Starbucks k-cups and now I can see why-10% of k-cups couldn't be used!Box arrived fine but many k-cups were crushed and not usable..disappointed!,3
I feel good giving them because they are healthy and my pets have loved them. Presently I have 3 cats and 1 puppy who share these treats. My previous dog loved them too. I always have a bag in the house.,5
"I drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea. Regrettably, the only good part about this tea was the price. The tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also. I will not buy this again and will stick to PG Tips or Yorkshire Gold.",1
"I honestly think this is the best box cake mix I have EVER had. I only went GF about three months ago, so I haven't just forgotten what ""real"" cake tastes like! I had to change the baking time to a few minutes under the lower end of the range given and the cake was perfect. I topped it with cream cheese frosting and it was SO delicious - moist and really chocolatey. No weird texture. I also didn't have any issues with it not lasting as long as other cakes, I had leftovers for almost a week and it only started to taste a bit stale on the last day or two. It smells a little weird when mixing and baking, but don't worry, it tastes amazing.<br /><br />I have never reviewed anything on amazon before but had to get on for this. After trying so many disappointing GF products - wow! Betty Crocker really did it right. It's not crumbly, dry, grainy, and doesn't have any weird off flavors from the different flours. Its price is very reasonable (especially if you buy it on amazon, the price for six on here is roughly the price of four boxes at my local store), and Betty Crocker almost always has coupons available for cake mixes if you do buy it in-store.<br /><br />This is most definitely going to become my go-to GF dessert. I can't recommend it enough to anyone avoiding gluten. It is so rare for me to eat a baked good now that is even worth the calories because most of them taste so bad. I have heard from some people the other GF mixes by Betty Crocker are not as good, but I have the yellow cake mix in my pantry right now and will try it out now that we've finished this cake!",5
I bought this for my son-in-law.  He loves Jelly Belly's but said that the flops are just as good.,5
I am so happy to be able to get this product on line since I have not been able to find this flavor in any of my local stores for the 3 years I have lived here...south shore of Boston.,5
"To me this seems to be little more than just water. Could it deliver special benefits that I am unaware of? That are tasteless, odorless and colorless? It certainly could. And the makers of the water claim that it does. But there is no way for me to tell. So I cannot recommend this product.",3
"My wife has recurring extreme muscle spasms, usually late at night or early morning.  We started to use this water for her about 6 months ago.  It has been the best purchase we have ever made [I am not kidding].  I haven't noticed anyone mentioning this benefit, but I can assure you it works!!  We ran out a couple of days ago and had to wait and do without for about 3 days.  She had awful muscle spasms in both legs last night.  Back to where she was before we starting using this water.  We were really thankful that we received 3 cases this morning.  I have vowed ""as god is my witness I will never run out of Essentia water again"" {from the movie Gone with the wind, ha ha]. But for real, we are now ordering 4 case per month so that we will never run out again.",5
"The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable.",4
Bought this product to increase my milk supply after reading reviews but it's just arrived and it says not suitable to take when nursing so now I'm not sure if it's safe to take. Very disappointed,1
"I guess you could call me a salt addict, I also guess it is a good thing that I have no blood pressure or heart issues as I am able to indulge myself with all different kinds of salts. This particular one is very nice and has a lovely mellow smoke flavor. The size of the crystals at first had me thinking I would have to use this salt in a grinder but I found that the large crystals are delicate and crush very easily in the fingers. I'll order more Spice Lab products based on how nice this salt is.",5
"For several years I could never understand why I could not get my mother's and grandmothers's old recipes to come out tasting the same way I remembered them to taste while growing up.  I said something to my mom one day and she asked what type of vanilla I was using and smiled when I told her it was just the basic stuff you get at the grocery store.  She told me to get some Watkins original vanilla extract and see if that helps.  Well, that was all it took!  I couldn't believe the difference and will never use any other vanilla again.",5
"I have used Watkins Vanilla extract for 50 years, and my family agrees that it has the best flavor, especially in puddings and custards.  I tried vanilla from Costco and everybody noticed the difference, in a negative way.  There is none better.",5
"Tastes better than 90% of the 'slimming' teas on the market and is NOT a laxative tea.  Definitely curbs hunger and makes me less likely to snack, especially in the afternoon when energy levels are getting low.",5
I just like the taste and the fact that it's green tea I haven't lost any weight but I love it just the same.  Sweet mild taste unlike regular green tea.,5
"My dog is obsessed with these- he literally comes running when I call out ""You want a Greenie?"" It also is a comfort to know that it is helping to clean his teeth!",5
This bag was not as large as I had hoped but seems to be of good quality.,3
I ordered one for my daughter & one for my mother-in-law.  Both of them really liked it.,5
"I was extremely hesitant to order this due to the few negative reviews, but I'm glad I took a chance.  I was told it was the best gift they've gotten in years (over and over again), and everyone at the party I went to was ""oooooing and ahhhhing"" over the beautiful blooms.  As a bonus, the tea was great!  I don't understand the bland reviews.  Definitely worth the cost, thanks Numi and amazon.<br /><br />Again addressing the scary negative reviews, there was absolutely no dirt/mud in or around the box and packaging.  I took the gift out of the amazon box and wrapped a red ribbon around it (the bamboo box comes wrapped in nice white paper), and it was good to go.",5
"On the Reeds website, this same product is available for $16.00.<br /><br />""Reed's Crystallized Ginger Candy 12 - 3.5 oz Bags""",5
"These nuts are really fresh and delicious! I have them on a regular monthly order.  I find them to have more salt than necessary, so shake them through a sieve to remove about 1/2 the sea salt.",4
These are so good we go through pounds a week. Amazon just had a sale that was wonderful in fact I bought up my limit and am waiting to find out when I can order more. Sit back with a cool drink and a package of these nuts and you will think your in Hawaii :-),5
"A MUST re-order!  Fresh, and delish!  Ordered again before the 1st bag was gone!  Yum!  Thanks for still being out there to order!",5
"I have used this starter for decades with excellent, consistant results each time. All Yogourmet starters are much better than others I've tried, I won't use anything else!",5
"my darling mutt & my fat cat love Mighty Dog; but,only the pulled style chicken dinner-& you can only buy the variety 12-pack in retail stores--so this is a great deal for me--",5
I chose this product because it makes the best brownies in the world!  The recipe is on the back.  To make even more delectable add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  The large size (48 oz) is great to have on hand for that brownie obsession.,5
"This is a really delightful tea.  It is perfect for that late afternoon ""high"" tea time when you just want to sit back and relax with a cup of tea.  It is also delicious cold.  It is now one of my favorites!",5
"True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)",5
"Cranberry. Cranberry is another one of those flavors that brings out very distinct memories for me. Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!",5
"My cats love this dry food more than others that I have tried. It's like kitty crack to them. I wish it came in bigger bags which would make life easier, less shopping. Also, I find that it is sometimes hard to find this at the grocery or pet store. I'm happy that I found an online source.<br /><br />Also, I have a cat that has a sensitive stomach and pukes up a lot of food but he seems to do well with the Whiskas. Again, Whiskas, bigger bags! That would help us multiple cat owners.",5
"I hate to blast the stuff, but it's major component is Fulvic acid, which give BLK in wonderful black color and unique mineral taste of iron and magnesium. Please note that Fulvic acid is a product of dead rotting organic matter. So basically if you went to your favorite lake or the Hackensack river, scrape up the soaked rotting leafs from the bottom of the water and squeezed out the water into a bottle, you would have made BLK.  It's not for me, But leafs more for you - Enjoy!",1
"Can you serve BLK Water from a Brita filter or would that cause a nuclear reaction? Mmmm, breakfast with green eggs and ham and BLK Water.",1
"I drank a bottle of blk in the dark so that the color wouldn't influence my opinion. First thing I noticed was a slightly bitter taste. It wasn't so bad and I drank most of a 16.9 oz bottle with no problem. There was a slight after taste as well. If the health benefits of this drink are real, I think they need to do something with the formula to make it more appealing to a larger mass of people. I like sparkling mineral water and I drink it because it contains those trace minerals that some bottled waters lack, and because I can still get some bubbles and not have all the sugar found in soda. I'm not 100% sure of the health benefits. Maybe offering a sparking version of this with some natural flavor like lemon would make this more appealing. I can understand the aversion that some people have. Dark, like a cola, yet a little bitter like hard water. It's a little confusing to the senses.",3
"This water tastes like sewage!!! Don't be hyped into buying it like I was. In going back and doing the research, there is nothing in this product that our bodies need except the water, which you can find in your kitchen. It looks horrible and tastes worse! If you feel you need to drink black/brown water, put some water in a glass, go out to your garden and dig up some dirt to add to it.",1
My favorite tea! And being able to sign up to have it sent to me on a regularly scheduled basis is the best!,5
Sambal Oelek is hands down the best chili paste out there. It is spicy but it is a different kind of heat than Tabasco for example. I put it on almost everything!,5
I have searched for a delicious blend of decaf tea and had found none until I brewed a cup of this tea and to my satisfaction I had discovered a delicious full body cup of tea. My  search is over.,5
Just wanted to say that it was a great deal and I won't shop for K-cups anywhere else.,5
These  were recommended by my nutritionist as a portion and calorie controlled snack. One bag is filling and satisfying!,5
We live in MO. And they don't sell look bars here.  I'm a California girl and loved them growing up.  Yummmmmy Fresh,5

"and she will evetually ""give in"" and eat this food, but she doesn't ""dive right in"" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!",3
"When I was a child my Father would always purchase antipasto in a can. It was imported from Italy.<br />It came in a round can it had sardines, capers, anchovies, tuna, olives,peppers,pearl onions.Packed in Olive oil.<br />with a sweet tomato sauce.The can was yellow with a embossed sun image smiling on the top of can.<br />It was delicious. They stopped importing it because the demand in Italy was so high.<br />I was trying to experience the same again with this product!<br />when I opened the can it was full of liquid and had a very bad fish smell.<br />I rinsed the contents off and added olive oil and a bit a ketchup to recreate the same as the Sole brand.<br />It was similar after I doctored it up I'm going to buy the items separatly and make  my own in the future.",3
"I love this tea more than I love any tea I have ever tasted. It smells like Froot Loops to the point where coworkers have walked by as I'm making a cup and asked, ""What smells like Froot Loops?""",5
"The product is okay, but 5-hr Energy (Extra Strength), and my favorite but no longer distributed - NOS Energy Power Shots, are far superior to Worx Energy Dietary Supplement (Extra Strength).<br /><br />With Worx, there's no jitters - so that's good.  It has that tangy citrus flavor like NOS energy shots (but not as yummy)...however, it taste better than 5-Hour Energy in my opinion.  Worth a try - you may like it!",3
"To begin, let me state that I'm a jelly bean fan. The cheaper and bigger, the better. Gourmet didn't mean anything to me; now it means ""tiny and strangely flavored.""<br /><br />On opening the package, an unpleasant smell hit my nose.  Later, I was able to determine that a few of the claimed 41 flavors were simply NASTY to my taste and nose.<br /><br />For the first handful, guessing the upcoming flavor was fun. Then that wore off and I just wanted the 35 flavors that tasted good to me. I guess you can't please everyone all the time.  Knowing when a nasty flavor is coming is critical.<br /><br />The blacks were a very rich liquorish, if you like that sort of thing.  There are multiple shades of each of the main standard colors and usually a spotted variety for each too. All of the flavors were unique to me, some were very good.  I missed some of the old standby flavors.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are extremely satisfying. Normally, I could eat a bowl full of other jelly beans. With these, I barely had the top layer and was satiated.<br /><br />I just hope I can figure out the terribly flavored ones and avoid them.",3
"I believe that this collection of coffee items was very satisfactory. I enjoyed the wide selection, especially the Tully's French Roast.",5
I had dark circles and uneven skin before I used this product. It works well. It's kind of on the expensive side for something so little though.,4
"I did a little research about these candies because I was invited to try them free. On their website you're able to compare a bag of Peanut M&M's, their #54's, and an Orange.. (or compare regular M&M's to the #41's in this review, and fruit). I was glad to see the list that they don't use partially hydrogenated oils (Trans Fats)...which I strictly ban in our house (but so do most candies nowadays, Corn Syrup is not a big priority for me as I don't consume much of it (and candy is a rare treat), ....GMOs (i'm not sure if the M&M's do (the side by side comparison should have shown us what they were up against. What I didn't like was that they failed to mention the saturated fat (which is at least around 3-4 grams...), AND the threw fresh fruit into the comparison. Why are you comparing candy and fresh fruit? This makes consumers think that your product is ""Healthy"" when in fact it is still candy, and should still be enjoyed in moderation, like all sweets that are heavy in fats, saturated fats, and sugars.<br /><br />Also, the #41 candy mentioned was 8 grams less per bag, which makes up for some of the lower amount in calories per bag, among other things. I'm glad to see the lower amount of overall sugar, which is a plus. But really, as someone who has struggled with weight all their life, this is still candy, not health-food. Moderation is key, regardless of GMO's, or high-fructose corn syrups.<br /><br />As a taste test, my husband and I decided to start with the #54's first. Ultimately these became our favorite. But we only each had a couple pieces and decided to call it quits. The #41's were fine. We just didn't feel like the candy was worth finishing. And we didn't finish it. This candy might satisfy someones sweet tooth, but if i'm looking for a sweet treat, I know plenty of other things worth the splurge!<br /><br />Please, please, please Unreal, stop comparing your candy to fresh fruit!! :)",2

"Senseo, I used to LOVE you, but then your products went dark for nearly 8 months, whats a gal to do without coffee?....now I have a Keurig, and Im happy again. Why do you come back to haunt me Senseo, and where did you go all that time???? Could I trust you again? I think not....",3
"Yay! Senseo has returned! At least the medium roast is available now. We ordered next day service and paid the extra fee just to get our Senseo. I had called DE and talked to them and they were having problems getting the Senseo to the US. Thankfully, my Dutch friend had no problems getting Senseo in Holland and so shipped us some in the meantime. Geez, I could open my own Senseo store! LOL Anyway, our Walmart had Melitta for the immediate need, but nothing is as good as DE's Senseo.<br /><br />Can't wait for breakfast blend and sumatra to return.<br /><br />Alley<br />Grand Prairie, TX, USA",5
"As the popularity of the Senseo pod system wanes and that of the Keurig system grows, there is diminished availability of pods that fit the Senseo. The Senseo brand pods are available on Amazon at a decent price. Unfortunately, the Senseo pods are not as good as competing brands formerly available on Amazon such as Fratello, Halo, Millstone, etc. Of the Senseo pods, the French Roast has a richer flavor than most of the others. It is often on sale and is a bargain when that happens. I suspect that the Keurig system makes good coffee, but I cannot imagine paying so much for a Keurig pod (thimble).",3
"My husband won't use any other hot sauce but Gib's.  It is a great amount of heat with an equal amount of flavor.  It goes great with anything you can think of.  It's impossible to find in any store - even the ""World's Largest Hot Sauce Warehouse"" didn't have this brand.  I recommend buying at least a half dozen bottles at a time, because it makes the shipping more proportionate to the product, and you'll use it - I guarantee it!",5
I like Green Mtn. coffee; but at almost .70 cents per K-cup get real. I have watched the price climb from a standard of .50 cents (on sale at.40 cents) per cup to today's so-called bargain prices of .68 cents. I know that over a year ago coffee harvests were down but that is over. In fact Brazil has a coffee glut. The price is being controlled by investors just like oil. Do not give in. I say boycott the product until they bring the price down to previous levels.,1
I BREWED IT ON THE 8.OZ SETTING BUT IT WAS WATERY AND NOT RICH.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,2
"These are supposed to be a ""crunchy"" bar, according to the package, but the nuts are the only crunchy thing about them - otherwise they're sticky, chewy bars!  Which doesn't mean they don't taste good - they do - but they stuck to my dental work something awful.  Before I knew that, I gave one to my Mom to try also - she wears dentures and couldn't even begin to eat one of these bars.<br /><br />That being said, the ingredients listing was pretty decent, not any ""weird"" ingredients or preservatives.  A little high in sugar content for my low-carb eating style, but enough protein to offset some of that.  They're really just a higher-protein candy bar, without high fructose corn syrup and no transfats either.<br /><br />For a quick, stick-it-in-my-purse type snack in case I get caught out and about with no other choices, these would definitely hold me over til I found something more suitable.",3
"If you are trying to quit using tobacco this is probably not going to do it for you.  It didn't work for me.  It tastes fine but is way too dry.  Also, naturally, there is no nicotine so you won't get any of the stuff you are hooked on in the first place.  I don't know what else you'd use it for except as maybe a substitute for ""bacon bits"" on your salad or something as due to it's dryness it's tough to get out of the can.",3

"I was tired of only having nasty, sugary, sulfite-added dehydrated foods to snack on.  This blend is so good!  I love that there is nothing added, and it is incredibly flavorful.  There is no residue on my fingers after eating it, and a little bit goes a long way to satisfy my craving for snacks.  I'll be be back for more, without a doubt!",5
"I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).",5
"By far the best tasting protein ""bar"" i have ever had. It resembles the taste/consistency of a cinnabun more then a protein bar though. It is very dense, very sweet, and also packs in a whopping 25grams of protein per bar. The only downside is that its hard to have just one!<br /><br />More seriously, though, the product is a tad expensive for a protein bar. In my opinion i would treat them as either a meal replacement or a treat after a huge workout. Casually eating these will end up making your wallet get slimmer (almost $2 per bar) and your belly a bit bigger (considering they have 300+ calories each). However as a meal replacement you cant beat it and the taste is phenomenal.",5
"I tried this coffee first when travelling in Europe, and I loved the intensity of the flavor. It doesn't taste burnt, and it's not unpleasantly bitter. I tried drinking other kinds of coffee that you can just find in a supermarket, but nothing compares to Douwe Egberts coffee. Also, I usually prefer to buy coffee beans, but I was able to find Intense only ground. I was afraid it would not be as fresh tasting because of that, but that is not the case at all. This coffee is one of the best I've had!",5
"Nice enough, but simply not one of those brews that makes me sit back, sigh, and say, ""Now, THAT'S a cup of coffee!"" I'm not sure how to describe what makes me do that: it's sort of a rich, smoky bitterness without acidity. This coffee wasn't acidic, it just lacked that smoky bitterness that I'm after.",3
"This is a good product, delivery was on time and there were no problems.  To help others who might have ""problems"" I will note the following:<br />1.  This is not the best white tea I have had, but it is of good quality at a reasonable price.<br />2.  Like other white tea, it is very sensitive to temperature and steeping time.<br />3.  Some people find white tea flat or flavorless, a pinch of lavender or other agent will help.",4
"Our 15 pound dachshund absolutely loved this toy but in less than a week he had the face chewed off, the eyes chewed off, the tips of the ears chewed off and a hole in the tail, plus had removed both squeekers. I don't recommend this at all. I'm just going to keep buying the $2 toys that last the same amount of time.",2
Delivery was delayed several weeks and not notified of delays.  I had to keep e-mailing to make sure it was coming.  Taste is OK but it will never make you forget the real thing.,3
"I had one sample envelope of this but thought it was far superior to Green Mountain (which I bought a box of.)  Green Mountain is good but a little thin for someone addicted to European style strong cocoa.<br /><br />However I notice a Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa comes in containers and by the pound and suspect it is the same as the so called ""specially brewed for Keurig.""  .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H70Q0K"">Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa, (2 lb Bag)</a><br /><br />Using the cocoa in the make your own filter may be a cheaper way to go or it may work just fine dropped in the bottom of the mug as you do with the envelope.  I have not tried this or priced it out.<br /><br />I would not buy a Keurig just to make cocoa, but it is great for tea and coffee and there is a wide selection.  It is for someone who has a couple of quality cups a day.  If you are drinking pots of coffee, it is going to be expensive.<br /><br />I have a lot of cocoa.  So far I have not found any that work better with the Keurig.  If they call for milk, they won't do well for sure.",3

"Finally Starbucks comes out with K-cups!! I have been waiting for Starbucks K-cups over the past 5 years. I love strong & bold coffee. The monopoly of coffee from Green Mountain largely can't deliver that bold taste. But I just brewed my first Starbucks French Roast K-cups. First, the aroma from the brew instantly reminded of Starbucks. Then the first sip. WOW!!! I couldn't believe how good this coffee is. I couldn't believe that my machine just made it. I can honestly say this was the BEST cup of coffee from my machine over the past 5 years. It is as good, if not better, than what you get when you visit Starbucks. If you are a Starbuck fan that enjoy dark, rich, bold, & strong coffee; you will NOT be disappointed!",5
"This is kind of a nice item, but not really what I was looking for. First, the body and the globe are plastic and not metal and glass. It only accepts quarters; pennies and dimes will fall thru, and nickels will jam--requiring you to take the mechanism apart. You can set it to vend large or small items. Set to full open, the gum ball wheel vends 5 or 6 small gum balls. It's very noisy compared to the little antique-style machine I have and much taller (less kid-friendly). This is not the sort of machine you can leave unattended (because it is plastic and prone to jam) and yet demands quarters, so it's not ideal for home use, unlike the penny machine I have (I can't very well leave a box of quarters next to it). Supposedly, you can set it for free-spin (there are no instructions on how to do this), but that takes the fun out of using it.",3
Tart and good granola. Flavorful and crunchy - a nice change and a great value.  Gluten- free breakfast has never been so enjoyable.,4
"Before trying it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about the combination of orange and cashew in my granola.  But, it really impressed me with a fantastic flavor!  I shouldn't have worried... I've never been disappointed with Bakery on Main granolas,.",5
Delightful mint tea as one would expect. Note that each tea bag is NOT individually wrapped; there is one bag inside the box which holds all of the tea bags in a ziploc pouch. I purchased these as a wedding favor (herbal-themed wedding) and it was fun bagging each one in its own small bag with a nice printed label and ribbon. The tea bag itself is good quality; I've never had one rip open and spill tea leaves into the tea.,5
"I LOVE Fromm pet foods and agree with an earlier review about my dog's coarse hair becoming soft and smooth after eating Fromm, but this particular variety is his worst enemy.  He puts his tail between his legs and delays eating it until late in the afternoon when he just can't stand the hunger pangs anymore.  Unfortunately, I had purchased a 30 lb. bag and he is a small dog.  We made it (barely) through a third of a bag before I sold the remains on the cheap to a friend.  Her dogs didn't care for it either, but her somewhat overweight dog ate it anyway (because she eats anything).<br /><br />Our local supplier of Fromm said that this variety is the least popular.<br /><br />Ironically, one of my CATS loves it!  Must be the fish in it!<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't given up on Fromm foods for my dog, but I will never buy this variety again.",3
"Latte's, Cappacino's and every other delicacy is fine but you can't beat a cup of Maxwell Coffee. This was a wonderful prchase my coffee habit is taken care of for a long while. Seller was prompt in shipping and it was everything they promised. This is a relationship I will cherish for years.",5
If you don't like products that are too sweet then this is the hard candy for you--very mild to taste. Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so. Read Bible every day.,5
"The cereal cups are cheaper here than buying them at the cafeteria at work and they are convenient. They also help with portion control because usually when I pour a bowl of cereal it can equal two or three servings. There are more Special K than the others, but that's ok I can add my own fresh fruit to them and still get a inexpensive and healthy breakfast.",4
"This is a great tea.  It helps with cardiovascular health and is also calming. No sweetener is needed since it has Stevia in it.<br /><br />I started drinking Hawthorn teas for my heart; specifically palpitations. Also, I am under a lot of stress right now because my 85-yr old father has recently been diagnosed with Dementia and he was sent to a skilled nursing facility from the local hospital after falling and breaking 5 ribs.  I am the oldest (and also disabled), and this was all left to me to deal with. My stress level has been extremely high, I have been having anxiety & panic attacks which include palpitations and a very unsettling,uneasy feeling. I had some Xanax that my Dr. had previously prescribed, but I ran out of it. Quite by accident, I found that this particular tea had a very calming effect. It is also really good tasting.  Bija teas carries another Hawthorn tea called Heart Health, but I have not tried it. When reordering I had to be careful to get this exact same one. Also, when looking it up online, most of the time it went to that other Bija Hawthorn Heart Health tea.",5
"My older cat has dander problems so the vet recommended this product.  While I was at it I put it in both my cats food<br /><br />It might have helped his skin and fur, but after giving him the quantity specified on the package, he got diarrhea.  I decided dander was preferable to diarrhea.<br /><br />The other cat ran when she smelled it in her food.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I use it rarely in smaller amounts for one cat and not at all for the other.",1
Sorry but this product tasted just awful.  I bought a few different flavors and did not like any of them (and I am a diet drink lover!)  It was very artificial tasting and left a strange after taste.,1
I hate when company knowingly put out a products that tastes bad. I don't think I'll ever by a Pepperidge Farm product again. The cookie and the chocolate are both tasteless. Nothing more to say. Only diabetics could enjoy this... maybe not even them.,1
"Marley One Love Organic Coffee comes in pods, though I was also able to use them in a refillable Keurig-style pod for a K-cup coffeemaker. I am definitely not fond of bitter coffee or of coffee that tastes burned, so this coffee was a delightful surprise. The aroma is quite pleasing, with notes that are almost fruity on top of the basic coffee scent, and the flavor works well on its own or sweetened and lightened to taste. I was raised on Community Coffee, and this is the first brew that might tempt me to switch.",4
"Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.",5
"I wasn't quite sure what I'd do with so much coconut, but I've started using 1/4 cup of this mixed with water in my Vitamix as a base for daily smoothies...  like home-made coconut milk (without the preservatives.!",4
I was very unhappy with my purchase .I had bought them a few weeks ago for a friend and she said they were very good.<br />I thought they were very hard and much smaller than i remember them .<br />Didn't think it was worth the money.<br />Sorry,1
"This is for Costa Rica blend. I do not like giving bad reviews but I rely on reviews myself , so I feel it important. Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes "" off"" and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend.",2
I HAVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND AM ON A STRICT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DIET WHICH I WOULD FIND DIFFICULT WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT -- EVERYBODY NEEDS A SWEETENER!,5
NOW stevia is the best I have used so far. I use it in many things...food and drink. The only way you will get an after taste with this product is if you use too much. It takes very little to sweeten food and drinks.,5
"I didn't realize there was sugar in the Stevia until it came.  It tastes really good, but I didn't want the sugar.",3
"The original Cholula Hot Sauce has been rated excellent by virtually everyone. From the un-official chile pepper spokesmen, Scott Roberts; - the Original Cholula is an excellent hot sauce.<br /><br />(Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement)<br /><br />However the variants - garlic, lime and chipotle are far inferior and don't match the quality of the original hot sauce.<br /><br />Hey - there is nothing wrong with trying a selection but Cholula has failed to meet the very high standards they set by their original hot sauce.<br /><br />Just a heads up.",3
"I like Stash Tea because I find that it consistently delivers good quality and great tasting tea. The Fusion Green and and White Tea is not exception. It is smooth, very aromatic and great tasting. It is one of my favorite teas and I drink it all the time.",5
"Can't miss with this when you really want to give something special. Product famous for quality.  Delivered on schedule.  Great, practical packaging.",5
"This is by far my favorite base to use in place of traditional stocks or bouillions. Much less sodium, lasts 10 times as long in the fridge and the flavor is more akin to a home made stock from reducing beef bones then the flavorless bouillions or stocks. It is great to add to a pot roast or chili or as that extra flavor to a quick beef stew. Absolutely love, I buy this over and over again. Wish I could get this locally!",5
"I thought I was receiving 8 packs of eight instead of 6 packs of eight, therefore, I paid way too much for this product.",3
This was a very good product! I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone!! I plan on ordering more when I can.,5
My dog liked them alot. For the price he should have liked them. I'm surprised the label didn't have gold inlay on it.,3
"I just became interested in middle eastern cooking, spices and techniques.  Plus, it has gotten expensive eating out at restaurants.  I purchased a tagine( my first) and when i received this product i knew i had made the right decision!!!  The recipe on the back of the package made my mouth water.  I went on to purchase some preserved lemons, zaatar spice and another bag of sumac from this company.  This is a good sized bag of product.",5
"I added two Schipperke puppies to my home eight years ago.  Shortly after they arrived, they became sick with a parasite known as coccidia.  From that moment on, I lived a wretched existence comprised of constant cleaning (both the dogs and anything they came near), dog antibiotics, vet bills, emergency room visits, more vet bills, on and on.  By the time they were two years of age, they were down to eating only rice mixed with turkey baby food (per vet instructions) and my bank account was depleted by thousands of dollars.  Yet still they suffered from diarrhea and occasional bouts of vomiting.  One day I found this food on the internet, and thought, ""what the hell - I've tried everything else.""  When the food arrived, I mixed the ""dust"" (reminded me of fish chum we used as kids) with cooked turkey, water, and olive oil.  I fed it to the dogs.  They loved it, but I expected after a year of rice and Gerber's, they'd have loved anything.  By day three, their diarrhea had stopped, and the only time it has returned in the past six years is when I have run out of this food and fed them something different.  Truly.  Day THREE!  After a two-year ordeal! This food saved my dogs' lives.  I notice that the formula has changed a bit over the years, and now the package directions suggest adding an egg and fish oil - and not to use olive oil.  I just keep making it the way I always have.  They still love it.<br /><br />There are downsides to using this food:  it's soft, so plaque and tartar build up much faster than if the dogs were eating crunchy food.  Also, I have to make a ""batch"" of food for them. I usually buy 2-1/2 lbs. of ground turkey, cook it up, grind it in the food processor, add it to 2 cups of dust, 2-1/2 cups of water, 1/4 cup olive oil, then mix it all together.  Then, using a small ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), I put the food into those small disposable plastic containers made by Glad.  This usually gives me 56 containers (two weeks' worth of breakfast and dinner for both dogs).  I freeze the containers, putting them into the refrigerator the night before as necessary.  In the morning, I dump the containers in their bowls, and microwave for 20 seconds.  I guess this is a long way of saying it's more labor intensive than throwing a handful of kibble into a bowl.  But, it has definitely been worth it for me and my dogs.<br /><br />I would enthusiastically recommend this food to any pet owner.",5
"I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.",4
"I know we pay more for individually packaged food items, and it's not the most environmentally friendly way to buy products, but it's so convenient to carry a couple of those bags of almonds that I don't mind overlooking the price and the extra packaging.  Love them on the go or when I travel.",4
"ADVANTAGES:  (1)These clams taste quite good.  (2)The can is easy to open with a can opener.  (3)Just as oysters are an extremely, extremely rich source of zinc, clams are an extremely, extremely rich source of iron.  (4)Clams are low in mercury and other marine pollutants.  (5)Clams contain a small amount of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which have been shown to prevent many human diseases.  (6)At less than $2.00 per can, the price is right.  (7)The quantity of clams in each can is adequately good.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Approximately 1 to 2 clams in each can will have sand in them or be attached to shell fragments.",4
"I was sceptical, but this stuff is great. It not ""quite"" peanut butter, but it close enough. Unlike some other peanut spread products I've tried which were entirely unpalatable this stuff makes a fine PB2&J sandwich for under 150 cals (low cal bread and sugar free jelly).",5
"I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!",5
"I've tried this low-sodium variety and it had a surprisingly ""peppery"" taste that I did not care for. Also, you can reduce the sodium content of other flavors by only using half or two-thirds of the seasoning packet. You will get more flavor, but end up consuming as much sodium - sometimes even less, depending on the variety - than you would if you ate this low-sodium kind  with its entire seasoning packet.<br /><br />Ramen has an unfair bad reputation. Use less of the seasoning, add some leftover frozen vegetables, maybe toss in pieces of leftover chicken or cooked bacon, and you've gotten a decent small meal. I'm not saying that you should live off of Ramen only, but Ramen recipes have gotten my husband and I through some financially-tough months in the past.",2
"Ordered their 6 month Frequent Flower club subscription off of Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was going to get but had some points I needed to use to I went ahead and ordered 6 months.  I was very impressed by the quantity and the quality of the flowers.  Each month I received a variety of flowers, two bouquets, sometimes two similar ones, sometimes they were different.  There were so many flowers I divided them up and made arrangements for the kitchen, the dining room table and even small arrangements in the bathrooms.  They're super fresh and come with several packets of preservative so as long as you change the water and cut them mine typically lasted at least 10 days looking super fresh.  This is my first month without them, I'm going to reorder another 6 months subscription because I really have missed them this month.  I'd highly recommend them!",5
"This product had an unannounced ingredient change. Chicken was added, which caused huge problems for my dog. The representative at Purina wrote back in response to my upset email to advise me they only changed the ingredients to the canned EN. Totally false statement. I had written down the 1st few ingredients in the beginning and I made a comparison when my dog got sick. Totally unacceptable!",1
This was a very good product! I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone!! I plan on ordering more when I can.,5
"ARrived in timely manner, as advertised. Chips are very crunchy, good as dippers, especially with hummus, or just by themselves. The chips had a few more broken pieces than the bags you buy in the grocery store, but for the money you save, the on-line purchase is definitely worth it. Will repeat order in future.",4
"Bought this pancake mix previously.  This is NOT banana macadamia nut pancake mix.  It is banana macadamia nut FLAVOR pancake mix.  The only place you see that in the product listing is if you look carefully at the item picture, and they even turn the bag sideways in the picture to make the word ""Flavor"" less obvious.<br /><br />If you're in to artificial flavors, go for it.

I've moved on to trying Amazing Grass which has been supplementing my daily vegi intake that I wasn't getting and has had more dramatic effects on my health.  I've switched from this product to taking two tablets of Lifesheild mushroom blend at night.  Overall I've seemed to have missed my yearly 3 day (or so) crippling sickness<br /><br />Good will hunting,<br />Tom",3
"I hope Amazon changes the heading from 30 to 80 count; this price for 30 count would be ridiculous.<br /><br />My doctor directed switching from coffee to tea.  He is no longer my physician but I began with Twinnings Irish and English breakfast teas; finally, I found Bewley's.  My breakfast tea style emerged into drinking one batch of 2 bags of Irish breakfast tea, for its strength, followed by using one bag of English breakfast tea an hour later.  Today I use Dublin morning tea-bags, 2 then 1 of course.  It falls in between these two breakfast tea types, slightly milder than Irish but perceptibly stronger than English...and still smooth.<br /><br />The physician made an erroneous assumption about my coffee habit.  I had only been drinking 6 ounces every morning, for years; occasionally decaf cappuccino after dinner.  He probably would have not recommended the switch to tea.  I am happy to have found a strong excellent tea, and have been on Bewley's for a year.  It is smoother and stronger than Twinnings, in my opinion, and about the same price.  A winner all around.<br /><br />If you drink your coffee as espresso, cappuccino, or french press, you will appreciate this strong smooth tea.",5
"I found a link to the tofu shirataki in an article on MSN.com talking about foods to stay away from.  Of course they weren't talking about staying away from the tofu shirataki noodles, but to steer clear on pasta, even whole wheat, claiming it to be a glorified junk food that quickly turns to sugar once digested.  Being Italian and an avid pasta fan, I quickly ""googled"" and found a link to Amazon.com on www.house-foods.com.  I ordered 5 packages of the noodles, because I have been eating health food for awhile and despite the poor reviews, I was ready to give these a shot.  I am so glad that I did.  They are like tough spaghetti.  By tough I do not mean, tire rubber, but more like over cooked.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I cooked them in marinara sauce, put them in broth and made an Asian style soup and served them with teriyaki chicken.  These things are so versatile and fabulous.  I am on weight watchers and an entire bag of these noodles has 0 points and only 40 calories with 4 grams of fiber.  You can't ask for a better alternative to pasta.  The expiration date is about 4 months from when you order, so you don't have to gobble them up immediately. It also makes stocking up more convenient.  I will be stocking up on these indefinitely!  My only complaint is that shipping is kinda high, but I guess they do have to be cold packed to stay fresh.",5
"THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED. THE NOODLES WERE DISGUSTING. IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE SHIPPED IN LIQUID AND NEEDED TO BE REFRIGERATED, I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THEM. THEY HAVE NO FLAVOR AND THE TEXTURE IS DISGUSTING. I NOW HAVE THREE PACKS OF NOODLES SITTING IN MY REFRIGERATOR THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. CONSIDERING HOW EXPENSIVE THE SHIPPING COST WAS, I WILL BE THROWING MY MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THE VEGAN WAY OF LIFE. THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE.",1
Color me happy when I found this product . Amazon has a vast selection of condiments that are so great. These packets travel great and are wonderful when going on a picnic.

"I'm a fan of regular rice Krispies, but this cereal is something gone horribly wrong.  It is much too sweet and has a really bad flavor to it - I'm not really sure how to describe it.  I'm a fan of lucky charms, cookie crisp, etc .. but I just can not eat this stuff.",1
"This licorice is very much like Twizzlers or Red Vines in texture, which I like. It is chewy without being too much so and not sticky. The flavor is good. It is distinctive without being overpowering, and no aftertaste.<br /><br />I normally don't care what my candy is made of or how many calories it has. After all, it is candy. I don't expect any healthy ingredients. However, since Newman's is promoting the organic aspects of the product I decided to comment on them. While the brand is ""Newman's Own Organics,"" only three of the eleven ingredients in the product are organic. The rest are conventional. At least there are no artificial colors or flavors. Calorie-wise, Newman's comes off slightly better at 3.1 calories/gram vs. 3.6 for Twizzlers and Red Vines.<br /><br />While the foil packaging may keep the candy fresh on the shelf, once opened there is no way to reseal the package. In all fairness, though, neither Red Vines nor Twizzler packages can be resealed after opening.<br /><br />When comparing 5 oz. packages of all three products here on Amazon, you find Newman's costs over twice as much as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEHSCY"">Twizzlers</a> and over 2.5 times more than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEF0B0"">Red Vines</a>. Twizzlers and Red Vines are made in the USA and Newman's are made in Mexico.<br /><br />For me, licorice is an occasional treat. Therefore, if I am in the market and craving a licorice type candy, I would probably reach for these, price not withstanding. I like the pomegranate flavor, and I think I would give the black licorice flavor a try as well.",4
"This is a wonderful tea.  But yes, it's expensive.  I wish it came by the pound, so I could afford it daily.",5

"I used to buy this gravy often when the ingredients matched those listed above. I recently ordered a case (for myself and to share with friends) because I could no longer find it locally.

Received product on time as promised in excellent condition.  Product is a delight to use in my gourmet dishes; adds a whole new level of flavor.,5
"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips.",2
"I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.",5
"Great tasting BBQ Chips. Going to buy more.<br /><br />At first, looking at the size of the bags, and just thinking about the concept of ""Popped chips"" I was on the fence. Glad I finally made up my mind.<br /><br />My only complaint is, that these bags are so small. I want to purchase a regular size bag. Maybe a box of six or something. Because if you buy in bulk you save. Having to buy a box of 24... all that extra packaging is going to cost you.",5
"I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!",5
"After my vet recommended switching from the basic Petsmart variety lo quality dry food, I tried Wellness canned cat food (even though the price was at least 3 times more expensive than the old Pro Plan).  My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!",5

"I have long been a fan of Lindt bars, and this one was no exception, although I do agree with another reviewer that most of the flavoring of this particular bar comes from sugar (19 grams, or about 1.5 tablespoons per serving!) and milk.  I was especially disappointed, though, to discover that this bar contains ""artificial flavoring"".  Read the label.  Apparently, some of their other products do as well.  Such a disappointment from what I thought was a gourmet chocolatier.",2
"I had wanted to try this popcorn for a long time, finally treated myself to some. It is pretty good, but I add a dollop of butter and a small amount of popcorn salt to the pan before it pops. I probably won't buy it again because I can make better popcorn from scratch myself.",4

"I use Senseo coffees at least twice a day. We have several flavor and roast varieties. Senseo is a Dutch roast coffee but the pads are made in Belgium. The medium blend is a very good tasting coffee and just right for me. This is the pad we use most often, and when making two cups at a time in the Senseo machine, we combine one medium roast with one decaf pad.... gives us a half-caf cup with great body and flavor.",5
"Reading the other reviews, I wonder whether I got a stale box! My tea tasted bland and even dusty. I couldn't taste the slightest bergamot. It was like something you would drink when you're camping in the boonies and it's raining and you have no other way to heat up. Like something out of one of those giant yellow Igloo dispensers you see at tailgate parties on foggy November mornings. I would rather drink hot water. After I tried this, I dumped out my mug and threw the box and its 15 remaining organic tannin packets into the compost! Ashes to ashes.",1
"i have 26 african violets, i was losing alot of leaves due to thrips and a few had cyclemen mites. i used these 2in1 fert/pesticide spikes in all of them, and now (3 wks later) i no longer lose any leaves and my violets are now healthy and growing strong. i've tried everything on the market to rid my violets of the pests but nothing worked until now. these spikes are great! but you have to wait for them to work, so don't give up on them, just when i thought they were not working, i saw a big improvement so give them time. i gave them 4 stars because you have to wait for results.",4
"My husband and I thought we would try a different ""high test"" coffee.  It wasn't as good and had a different finish to it.  We are sticking with the Jet Fuel!",3
"I got the Keurig coffeemaker for Christmas.  Was skeptical that it could brew a cup of coffee strong enough for my taste.  After trying all the k-cup samples that came with the maker I decided that the extra bold k-cups were strong, but not quite what I was looking for.  Started reading reviews and decided on Black Tiger.  Found what I was looking for.  Great taste, not bitter, strong enough for me (the largest size brew is not strong enough, but the next size down is perfect).  Highly recommend this k-cup.",5
"I often find cookies way too sweet. These are WONDERFUL. Sweet, but not TOO sweet.  They are delicious.  However, I agree--don't buy them on Amazon, that is an AWFUL price.  You can get several more boxes if you just go to the grocery store.",5
I loved nestles diet (low cal) hot chocolate with marshmellows. It was only 30 or 35 calories. Have they stopped making it??? Can not find it anywhere. It was the best!,5
These chips are great with tzatziki and hummus. They are very light but actually taste like lentils.  I highly recommend them.,5
"tastes fantastic, but a little too much fat (3g/serving)<br />- wish the manufacturer reduces fat some more.<br />at trader's joe available with 2.5gms fat.<br /><br />but really need to be under 2 gms fat.",4
"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS.",2
The chocolate was outstanding.  The service was quick.  The value of the product exceeded what I paid.  I'm very satisfied.  This is my second<br />purchase of candy from Amazon.com and I will do it again.,5
"I love these sunflower seeds. I found them up when I was out of town and loved them so much, I had to order more online. These are a pretty good price and so tasty! These are by far my favorite!",5
"I have been drinking the Cafe Altura French Roast for a long time-the price is great and the beans are top quality--no quakers--the little shrivelled ones that Cook's Illustrated showed cause that truck stop coffee taste. The French Roast does seem to make a huge mess when I grind it--lots of static, and the Columbian Dark Roast doesn't. Best of all, though, is that the flavor of the Columbian Dark Roast is just as rich and low acid, without any ""burned"" taste. It has a rich complexity missing from other dark roasts. Yum yum!",5
"This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor, not overpowering.",5
I received this as a gift and I'm thankful for the thought but really glad I didn't waste my own money on this stuff. It's terrible. Carnation cocoa from a paper package is way better by comparison. I love chocolate and this stuff is watery and flavorless. Don't waste your money.,1
"Another great Numi tea, having had Numi many times before I knew I'd love this one and was THRILLED to see it as a gold box deal(what a steal amazon thank you!). The best mint tea is the fresh kind but this is so good you might not noticed the difference!",5
"I buy this snack for my home, it's delicious! My family loves it! It's low calorie, gluten free, non gmo and tastes delicious! Perfect snack to take on family vacations, give to the kids for school, and munch on while watching a movie! 24 count is great! Ensures that we're always stocked!",5
"I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made.  If it is made in China, I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food, cat food, jewelry, tooth paste, baby formula, and more.  I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits.  They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money. I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low, which is a tell-tale sign it was made in China.",3
"A blind taste test was conducted among three members of the family ranging from 8 to 49 years of age. We used Poland Spring bottled water and Essentia 9.5 ph water, both cooled to identical temperatures. No family member was able to tell the difference in taste. Comments ranged from, ""It's water, right?"" to ""Did you put the same thing in both glasses?"" So...it looks and tastes like water.<br /><br />We next tested the pH using materials drawn from a 40 year old Gilbert Chemistry set. Remarkably, the Essentia water was, in fact, between pH 9 and 10, quite a bit more alkaline than the Poland Spring or tap water, both of which proved to be neutral in pH. A phenolpthalein solution turned pink when mixed with Essentia water but remained clear with both the Poland Spring and tap water.<br /><br />A MedLine search did not reveal any evidence for studies that have definitively identified health benefits of alkaline water. One study indicated that patients with metabolic acidosis due to renal failure may benefit from alkaline water, but human studies are still necessary to demonstrate any real value.<br /><br />Some individuals may enjoy using this water to mix with concentrated orange juice for a low-acid product. Drinking it alongside a high-acid meal such as a meal containing tomato sauce may reduce heartburn/reflux. Your mileage may vary. Otherwise, I'd be concerned about the potential negative impact of drinking large quantities of alkaline pH water without neutralizing it in advance. I don't see that any long term studies have been conducted to demonstrate safety of high volume intake of alkaline water.<br /><br />But for occasional use, this tastes just like any other bottled water.",3
"Essentia is purified water with a 9.5pH. What makes this water different from others on the market are the electrolytes. I conducted a taste test with my teenage boys to compare regular bottled water with Essentia. They loved the light, fresh taste of the Essentia water. They thought it tasted clean and refreshing. Compared to regular bottled water, this water is much smoother. It is purified by reverse osmosis which is a filtration method that removes large molecules and ions from solutions. The boys also liked the size of the bottle. Overall, they preferred the Essentia water. I would definitely recommend it.",5
"I tried both the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea Mio flavors and while I liked them both, I definitely prefer the Peach Tea. The Mango Peach is just TOO sweet for my taste, providing a flavor that tastes a little too much like Peach flavored sugar water. The Mango should even the flavor out but it doesn't. This flavor is best when your water is ice cold (as in full of ice). The closer to room temperature your water gets the sweeter the flavor gets and more difficult to drink. And this review comes from someone who used very little (one squirt). My husband likes it better than I do, but he also adds 4 packets of sweetener to his coffee.",3
"I've tried this flavor of MIO, as well as the strawberry watermelon, and my main reaction to both has been that the flavor is not natural tasting and is far too sweet.  MIO mixed with water creates a flavor not unlike a kids' juice drink, which is not something I prefer.  The taste is sticky sweet and very artificial.  Obviously, something like this is highly subjective, so I'm sure many people love it...it's just not my style.  I will say that MIO is very convenient.  The packaging is small and easy to keep in a desk at work, for instance, or a purse.  Also, there is no need to really stir the liquid, so it has an advantage over Crystal Light or other similar powder products.  Nonetheless, I would need to see major flavor changes before I would buy this again.",2
"For a tiny little container, MIO includes quite a bang for the buck! The most important factor, of course, is taste and everyone in my family loves this flavor. We can add it to tea or lemonade or simply enjoy it in a chilled glass of water. In winter, it is the perfect addition to yogurt or oatmeal, adding variety to these basic products.<br /><br />Soft drinks can take up space and the packages can be difficult to lug but even those with limited space can find room for a MIO container. We have a small desk organizer with several MIO containers neatly arranged in a row. The organizer takes up about 6 inches or less, front to back, in a cabinet, and even less width-wise. Compare that to the space required by soft drinks.<br /><br />If you like to have something on hand to add to water while working, this is convenient to keep in a desk drawer and eliminates the noise of a pop can being opened in a shared office space.",5
"I purchased these organic lollipops in the 30-ounce container for my baby shower so that the attending parents could read the ingredients on the label. Needless to say, everyone was happy, including all the children and adults. These lollipops are the perfect size for little ones!",5
"It's really hard to believe Amazon is selling this stuff.<br /><br />No kidding, on the lid it says ""Best by Sept '06.""  These things are stale, soft - stinky.<br /><br />Out they go!<br /><br />Amazon should take their inventory and turn this stuff into hog feed.",1
"We use these as an after dinner treat for patrons leaving our restaurant and adults and kids both really enjoy them! Sure, it's a sugar filled treat, but i do like the fact that it's organic; I don't know if the organic quality has much bearing on our customers, but they certainly enjoy them!",5
These are excellent.  I wish the company would charge more and put six bars in a box but when you've got a good product you can do whatever you want.  I will be a repeat buyer. Dairy free and Almond butter YUM.,5
"... but it would be desecration to put this gunk on any decent pasta, let alone Rustichella's. Jarred pesto is to freshly-made pesto as instant coffee is to freshly-brewed mocha-java from Peet's. I've been silly enough to try various brands of pesto in jars, and none of them would glean more than two stars. The frozen brands are marginally better, but the only justification for store-shelf pesto is the unavailability of fresh basil, Even then, you'd do better to make a pesto recipe with any soft herb you have: arugula, dandelion, parsley, mashed artichoke ... if I lived in Nunavut I'd probably use lichen from the belly of a caribou rather than depend on jarred pesto.<br /><br />Here's a basic pesto recipe for a small batch:<br /><br />50g of basil leaves<br />Extra virgin olive oil<br />6 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano<br />2 Tbsp Pecorino (romano, toscano, sardo or siciliano)<br />2 cloves of garlic<br />1 Tbsp pine nuts<br />Coarse sea salt<br />The traditional method uses a wooden pestle and a marble mortar. Start by pounding the garlic and salt until you get a smooth paste.<br />Add the basil, a handful at a time, and keep grinding until each batch of the leaves is incorporated. To preserve the essential oils in the basil, don't be too rough with it.<br />Add the pine nuts and grind some more.<br />Add the cheese and mix well.<br />Add the oil, little by little, until the pesto has the right consistency - a matter of taste.<br />Serve with pasta or added to minestrone. The recommended pastas are troffie, trofiette or trenette, but it goes with just about any pasta. I usually serve it with spaghetti or linguine.<br /><br />If somebody has an interesting variation, post it as a comment.",2

"Purchased this on the advice of Dr. Mark Hyman, the well known author. I take a tablespoon or two with a glass of water right after breakfast and again after dinner and it keeps things moving, especially when eating a diet that's high in protein and low in fiber. Any other health benefits that come with it are bonuses as far as I'm concerned.",5
"I'm in my late 60's & I find it gives me a boost when I need one. There are days I wouldn't get anything done without it.  Used properly, it's great, DON'T ABUSE IT!",5
"This is good pasta for those who have gluten problems. Cooking this was a tough job at first because at usual heat for pasta this becomes a starchy paste in 1/2 the time. So i actually wasted two packets before searching google to learn ""how to cook corn pasta?"". The key is very low heat with lots of stirring. But It turned out to be good and tasty finally",5
always like this cookies i used to get then from kellogs store but they closed up and sent me a letter telling me i could get from amazon  glad they did,5
I love Keurig coffee and this is an excellent mix of flavors. Keurig coffee is so much better than regular coffee. I find myself a lot more awake in the mornings from these yummy and just bold enough flavors. :),5
"I was really looking forward to trying different brands and flavors of coffee but this assortment was 90% Green Mountain and 75% some type of vanilla.  It included 4 Blueberry (haven't tried that yet but not really happy about it).  I get the impression that you get about 4 or 5 of a good variety and then a handful each of whatever flavors don't sell very well.  Luckily I'm okay with all the vanilla but this definitely was not a ""variety"" pack.",3
I've bought these cookies from my local store and they are hands down the best organic sandwich cookie.  All other brands of organic sandwich cookies come no where near on taste and texture.  I always get this brand now.,5
"This is good stuff.  I love to drink it and relax.  No hangover next day, nice sleeping.  Not sweet.<br /><br />I drink this now frequent and it is just an incredible product.  Will purchase more.",5
"I like these because they are not too big, so the bag lasts a little longer. My dogs love them. Price is pretty reasonable too.",5
"These Kippers are very tasty the flavor compares to Appel Kippers only the consistency is compared to the big meaty Appel Kippers slightly mushy this varies from can to can on the ones I have eaten so far. That being said the price is so good I intend to continue to purchase these as they are great in a salad or anything along those lines.<br /><br />Really great smoked flavor not a hint of fishiness. If you have a taste for kippers give these a try the price is downright cheap for the quality. If you have never tried kippers you may be in for a treat.<br /><br />I have turned several folks onto Kippers who have never had any smoked fish or some lousy stuff and most of them complained of the aroma when I was eating Kippers (especially at breakfast) but once they actually ate some suddenly they converted on the spot.<br /><br />These are second on my list of Kippers behind Appel but for the price difference it is a no-brainier to grab some of these Polar Kipper Snacks at about a buck and a quarter a can, wow what a bargain.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  High Quality for a Low Price.",4
"I have been ordering polar kippers on autoship from amazon for some time. Makes a quick and easy breakfast for me, and has served as a good substitute for breakfast bacon for me. While they still have fat, they are good fats. the smoky and salty flavor satisfy my taste at the same time. I eat a whole can which is supposed to be two servings, but even then it comes to a total of 162 calories.<br /><br />I have had on occasional problem with a lid not coming off cleanly but it wasn't a big deal to work around. Also some cans will vary slightly in the contents but it all averages out, especially when you eat them on a regular basis as I do.<br /><br />Buying on autoship is the cheapest way by far to get kippers with free shipping I am usually around $1.10 or so a can vs. $1.50+ in my local grocery. Plus I get a regular supply which fits nicely into my every other day or so diet plan.",5
"This is one of my husband's favorite teas.  I wish it weren't so expensive, but it does last a long time.  I bought an 8 ounce bag and received 4 separate 2 ounce bags, which is quite a waste of packaging.",5
"I have been suffering from IBS for a while now and this tea is the only thing that works for me when I am having cramps. I think IBS is a very personal problem and non of us have the same issues and solutions as the next person. For me fennel in general has been a great relief and I like Heather's tea bags because they taste good, they smell good and there are enough seeds in each tea bag to prepare tea in a big mug. I also tried their soluble fiber and that was a great product as well. Overall I recommend Heather's products and especially this tea if you are on the d-IBS side and need relief from cramps associated with it.",5
"I have had mild IBS all of my adult life...  I drink this tea all day and it has eliminated the bloated feeling and gas.  It is the ONLY thing that got me through Christmas. With all the holiday foods around, it allowed me to indulge a little and survive without having to ""pay the piper"". It is certainly an acquired taste, which you might not like if you do not favor licorice.  It really helps bloating if you use it on a regular basis even if you don't have IBS...",5
Delish!<br /><br />I've been using it on ham sandwiches...but would also be good for chicken or pork dishes.  Can't get enough of this stuff!,5
"The taste it's OK, it will just pick up other flavors in the dish but is a fantastic option for dieters. Just replace your diner mael with a bag of these with some veggies and tell me after one week.... For a great tasting meal, add one teaspon of peanut butter. DELICIOUS!!!!! but it will add about 100-200 calories to the dish which is a lot. I only recommend this variation very ocasionally, otherwise you won't loose weight. I buy this product in bulk from Konjac.",4
"First off, this soup will fill you up well because of the beans and rice. But I can't get over the sour flavor that<br />this soup has. It has lime in it so I figure that is what I am tasting, but its too much lime flavor and it gets in the way of the spices that are otherwise very good in this soup.<br /><br />Not so sure I'll order this one again but I might try a different flavor from the same company.",3
"I've eaten these rice sides for probably 10 years or more now, and this Cheddar Broccoli variety used to be my favorite.  Unfortunately, a while back, Knorr bought out the Lipton line of rice products and subsequently proceeded to cut costs in any way possible to make more money.  This has unfortunately resulted in the previously quite cheesy rice dish being reduced to a shadow of its former self.  I bought a box of these because I hadn't had them in a while, and because the Chicken and Broccoli variety still holds up well enough only to discover that the new mix results in a very wet cheese sauce (after cooking in the microwave according to the package directions) that is considerably less cheesy than one would expect.  Eventually enough of the sauce will evaporate/soak into the rice & pasta mixture to increase the flavor a bit, but I can't recommend it anymore.  It's become thoroughly average in every respect.",3
The best water I have ever tasted.  no one else comes close.  Not all bottled water is created equally.  Don't buy the cheap stuff.  Tastes like night and day.,5
"If you love smooth, rich dark chocolate, and you also love ginger, the combination will astound you.  This is one of the best chocolate bars I've ever had, hands down.  Each piece is worth savoring, slowly...",5
I tried everything and my cats didnt bother with it. They let the stuff rot inside.,1
"The syrup is very thick and sweet.  Too thick, in my opinion - it feels like it should be watered down with about 1 part water added for every 3 parts syrup to make it a better consistency.  Probably works great for snow cones where you want it to stick to the ice chunks, but for shave ice, it needs to percolate down, and it doesn't.  So you're constantly adding more.  And it's not just the flavor that's too concentrated - the color is too.  My 4 year old had blue lips for 2 days after eating shave ice with the blue raspberry syrup on it.  For reference, our preferred brand is Hawaiian Snow (substantially superior taste, IMO, but you have to order it from Hawaii and mix it yourself), and the staining only lasts a few hours, or until the next meal.  It's OK, hence the 3 stars, and we'll probably use it up eventually, but I don't think I will buy more.",3
Purchased as a gift. My sister-in-law is a baker and ordered these for her to go in a cupcake accessory box. She loved these.,5
"REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.<br />THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE.  THEY WERE MOSTLY GINGER SNAP CRUMBS!<br />I HAVE ORDERED THESE GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES OFTEN AND THE MOSTLY CRUMBS WAS A FIRST.  I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.<br />HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN.",3
My partner only eats white chocolate.  It's difficult to find GOOD white chocolate to satisfy his tastes.  He says this is the best he's ever had.  I'll re-buy every Christmas!,5
I first bought these biscuits in a specialty store in another town.  My dog loves them!  I could not find them where I live.  I found them here and get them on line now for a better price.  I highly recommend them.  My dog cannot have any sweet because of her tendency toward diabetic like symptoms.  These are healthy and tasty and have NO molasses in them.  Every biscuit now a days has molasses.  WHY?  These biscuits make us BOTH happy!,5
"I see alot of people slamming this product for using other than baking needs,and I guess I can understand if you are cutting this powder with 2-1 water and trying to scramble!However,if you try using milk(I actually use powdered milk as well,but thats your call),and just add a tiny little bit of liquid at a time until you get to the consistency you need,and make sure to butter the pan(use a little oil as well to keep butter from burning),you will find this item is NOT as bad as all that scrammbled,it is however,hard as heck to try amd make an omlet out of this stuff,but add a few other items,green peppers,onions,selentro,spices,etc,and you will find they arent all that bad,they definately are NOT farm fresh eggs,but no-one ever cliamed they were,just cut WAY back on the liquid to powder ratio,and cook it SLOWLY using a buttered luke warm pan,bring it up to medium to medium low temp stirring constantly until done,you will find yourself liking this stuff,just my opinion,but give it one more shot using milk or powdered milk,and only tiny bits at a time,and you may be surprised!",4
"The Asian Pear nails you with an overwhelming aroma and not much improved flavor; I love Asian Pears but didn't find these comparable. Same with the Fuji apples, which taste..just..old. The strawberries and bananas are clearly the best, but still have a slight off taste to them.<br />PS Snagged 'em @ Costco...For cheaper, but the same product, of course.<br />BTW: Last time I checked, that's not what an Asian Pear looks like, box.",2
My Golden LOVES these! Although they are (my opinion) a little pricey I believe them to be a good investment. They are a hard biscuit so they help with keep his teeth clean and also they have glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in them which is good for his joints. I can't find them anywhere locally so I have to order online. I haven't found a lot of difference in the actual cost of the product but I've found Amazon gives me the best rate on the shipping and overall is the best deal.,5
This product totally reminds me of Lipton Lemon ice tea. It was really really good. Makes for a good sleep and relaxation aid.,3
"I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn't go to waste.",1
Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.,3
"I had been interested in making my own salad dressing and after trying Napa Garden's Salad Dressing Mix, I highly recommend it. I made the salad dressing recipe included on the label and it is very good. It improves as it has time to infuse the flavors in the oil and vinegar.  Later, I cooked some summer squash in a light drizzle of the dressing and they tasted great.",5
I bought this for a gift for my father and he loved it.  The only down side is the price.  I will only get these as gifts and not as a food staple due to the cost.,5
"In my hunt for good strong decaf, I've tried many. This is the best, alongside Tetley. I actually drink a 14 ounce cup in the morning using one bag of Tetley decaf and one bag of Ty-phoo. One would be hard pressed to guess it was full decaf. I'm throwing out my PG Tips. After forty-or-so cups, I've given it a good trial, but it's just too ""green"" for me. Sticking with this one...just placed another order. Ty-phoo is strong, with no weird designer tea flavors added, and no off-tastes. As close to the caffeinated tea you really want to drink as you will get.",5
"Very nice sugar substitute, and great that we can get it via web purchase, since it is not available in stores.  Thanks, Amazon!",5
"I love sensational flavors and these almonds really deliver.<br />They get sprinkled on many of my Thai dishes, stir fries, and fried rice medleys for extra crunch, calcium, fiber, and protein.",5
"The price for 12 oz of these cookies is absurd. They are good, but not worth the money. Buy them at Costco (24 oz bags) for less!!",2
The cans arrived undamaged and the contents are delicious. This cream makes wonderful frozen pina colada's and I am glad I bought the case. It will just last the summer!,5
"...about this water as everyone else. To me, it tastes a bit like unsweetened mouthwash. I guess I was just expecting something different. I've only tried the Spearmint so far, and I've noticed in another review that this one is not a favorite...a bit scared to try the others though in that I'm not very enthusiastic about my first one...",3
My 2 boxers loved these bones. The only negative is that the bones don't last long. My dogs ate them up in 1 day....better stock up!,5
"If you enjoy  drinking tea in the morning or most any time during the day, this product is very good.  I recommend it highly.",5
My baby enjoys this product & eats it regularly.  Though when I ordered it online it froze during the shipping process (we live in MT).  This changed the texture from thick & creamy to more chunky & brothy.  She didn't like it as much & I actually threw the last several out.  So I don't reconmend freezing.,5
Great Coffee! Great Price! Great Vendor! My wife loves this coffee and the convenient pack for the Kuerig makes it easy to use and enjoy!,5
"Mango Pickle, every day. On it own, will turn mediocre curry into good curry--and send good curry over the top. The flavors are just right for co-topping with yogurt, raisins, and diced apples. Need a good dip for some ""bachelor chicken""? This, some mayo, and some creamy italian--you'll figure out the right proportions.",5
Hi! love that brand zukes chicken mini treats and my dog love it and it is natural and healthy for my dog.,5
My black lab will do ANYTHING for the peanut butter treats. She literally goes crazy for them. I wouldn't use anything else for training.,5
"I have used this dog food for years, and I have never had any problems with it in the past.  Prairie must have put out a bad batch of it to the point where it should have been recalled (I found many bad reviews after the fact).  It smelled terrible upon opening the bag, and my dog turned her nose away from it.  I won't begin to tell you what she is normally willing to eat.  I've had to switch brands, and I doubt I will be returning to Prairie in the future.  Amazon responded beautifully to my concerns, I just wish they had known about the bad batch up front so it wouldn't have been sent in the first place.",1
"This is one of the best snacks I have ever had.  I used to eat these in Japan all the time.  I was craving some so I looked online.  I am hoping they will start selling them in the US.  They are kind of tough to describe but basically they are small pretzel nuggets.  They are covered with various flavors but basically salty.  I love the original flavor but they have been coming out with lots of different kinds (chicken, bacon black pepper etc).  There is always a picture of beer on the front of the package because they go great with beer, but really you can eat them anytime.  You would think I was doing a commercial..but seriously I was just looking to eat some and was happy that I got the chance to be the first to review!",5
"I use the Splenda Mocha flavor in my coffee everyday.  I do use a Nespresso coffee machine which makes strong coffee.<br /><br />I love this product, and I recommend it strongly.",5

"I absolutely Love Popcorners, and the Caramel Flavored are out of this world.  My new favorite snack.  The vendor also made this purchase extra special!",5
"I've been eating Cream of Wheat since I was a kid in the 50's but recently discovered the whole grain version.  I made it this morning with skim milk instead of water and then added another tablespoon of non-fat dry milk to boost the protein content and it was really, really good!  I'm just 3 weeks post weight-loss-surgery and am eating only soft foods and only in tiny amounts. It's hard to find something with the right consistency that's filling and loaded with so many of the needed nutritients.  This is my new favorite breakfast!",5
"The manufacturer of this product needs to significantly improve their quality control of bottling this product. I received my first two jars of this yesterday and this morning as I opened the first jar the lid would not unscrew. When I forced it to open I saw that the stevia had not been properly sealed beneath the lid and the powder had filled the screw top and even spilled out into the plastic casing around it. Naturally since the seal had been compromised I was unable to use the contents of that jar. I opened the second jar and it was properly sealed and the taste of the contents was quite good. Unfortunately I will not be able to purchase this anymore because I have lost faith with the manufacturer's quality control and because it is a food product Amazon cannot accept returns. I am adding this note to tell all that when Amazon found out about the defective jar, they sent me an email informing me that they are mailing me a free replacement of the entire order and it has already shipped on the same say I notified them. Now who can complain about that?",2
"The right combination of sweet and spicy, perfect on Brie and crackers.  I never thought about cooking with this, but since I found it at Costco for $7.99 (twice the amount that comes in the jar) it would be wonderful on chicken or some seafood.",5
"At what point during the day can I no longer consume Breakfast Blend?<br /><br />I turn to you, fellow K-Cup aficionados.  I regularly enjoy a cup in the AM, typically between 8am-10am.  But yesterday I tried a cup around 3pm and it tasted like I was licking a clown's elbow.<br /><br />I'm assuming y'all will recommend noon as a safe cutoff, but I'd really like to incorporate BB into my post lunch rotation.  How late can I enjoy a cup without it feeling like I'm drinking a bucket of sand?<br /><br />Thanks.",5
"Hazlenut is my favorite flavor in coffee and this brand delivers. Buying online is convenient and a fast way of getting what you want.  I also like the butter toffee but it can be a strong flavor.  If you're not into heavy flavors in your coffee I wouldn't recommend it but if you do, it's the flavor for you.",5

"I have bought this one 8-10 times and have loved it every single time. I love the texture of the potatoes and the consistency and tangy undertones in this Kadi. It is seasoned right with a fair amount salt, the way I like it. And it is ample quantity for myself and my wife and gives respite from mundane home-cooked food on boring weekdays. I must say though that this review would be useful and appropriate only for a south Indian as myself, and I honestly cannot attest to the authenticity of taste for a traditional North Indian item as this is.",5

"I've tried a few brands of truffle oil and I really haven't been able to tell the difference between qualities.  All are super pungent with that lovely aroma and taste that truffle oil brings.  I used this on salads and also to oven bake/fry potato chips (recipe to follow). The price is great which is why I bought it.  Truffle oil can get pricey quick.  Depending on how often you use it, it is great to find a economical source!  Love this stuff!<br /><br />Potato Chips:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />* 2 baking potatoes thinly sliced on a mandolin<br />* Garlic powder<br />* Salt<br />* Pepper<br />* Olive oil (75% of the mixture)<br />* Truffle oil (25% of the mixture)<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F<br /><br />2. Pour enough olive oil and truffle oil in baking pan/sheet to thinly cover entire surface area.<br /><br />3. Move pan around to coat evenly.<br /><br />4. Put pan in oven for 2-3 minutes to heat oil.  Remove pan from oven.<br /><br />5. Sprinkle desired seasonings in the oil.<br /><br />6. Place sliced potatoes in oil (will fit about 1 large potato per baking sheet).  Do not overlap!<br /><br />7. Bake for 8 minutes, flip potato slices over.<br /><br />8. Bake until done 5-8 min (continue to check as the outside ones will crisp sooner)<br /><br />9. For round 2: Reapply some oil and seasonings.  Repeat process",5
"I am one who loves very strong flavors and a lot of spice in my food.  With that in mind, This sauce was incredibly rich tasting. Very creamy, with a distinctive taste of coconut.  It's not the same as taking a mouthfull of fresh coconut or drinking coconut milk, but you can discern the sweet coconut flavor.  I made Chicken and shrimp Korma last night, using extremely thin sliced chicken breast (the kind of cut most oriental places put in their moo goo pai pan and other chicken dishes)  The shrimp was 31-40 count.  I added some fresh steamed veggies to the mix as well, and put it on a bed of Basmati rice.  I heated the sauce, dumped it over top, and served it family style.<br /><br />I thought the combination of the sauce with chicken, shrimp, AND veggies all worked, so its a versatile sauce.  I think it might go well with just about any meat or veggie option.  It did wear on my towards the end of the dish, however, due to the richness.  I would have prefered a bit stronger garam masala flavor, so I compensated and added a little into the sauce.  I won't be making this all the time, but every once and a while its a refreshing taste in indian cooking.  I still think I'll stick to Patak's vindaloo paste.  That's become a staple in my house when I'm not in the mood to make curry pastes from scratch.",4
"I really like the ginger root beer, and have just ordered a case. But the cola was awful; had a bitter taste.",5
I love it.  I have to watch my sugars so I only use about 1/2 ounce as a sweetener for my shredded wheat mini biscuits.  It adds some additional flavor and a different crunch to the breakfast.  I love the subscription option.  The new batch comes just as the old is running out.,5
"Kashi Go Lean Crunch is the only cereal that we eat.  It has no partially hydrogenated oils, no trans fat and no other bad additives.

The Kashi company knows how to make cereal!!!! AAAAAAAAAAA+",5
I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.,5

"I usually like something sweet to end a meal.  The problem with that, of course, is the calorie overload.  So then comes along this caramel and chocolate popcorn.  I like the size of the pack if I've eaten something else already because it's not too big and not too small.<br /><br />There's enough snack in the bag to be just right without being over the top in sweetness.  Best when eaten with something else though, rather than on it's own because then, not so filling.  The flavor of the drizzle and the caramels seem to be pretty balanced so one doesn't totally overtake the other and the conistency of the popcorn is just the right amount of crunch without being soggy.<br /><br />I liked it and would recommend it for others who don't want a big calorie laden and heavy meal finisher or treat.  My mom took a packet to work and told me several of her coworkers wanted to know where they could get their own and they're a pretty picky bunch, so it must be good!",4

I like a combination of salty and sweet, so they hit the spot for me, but other members of the household felt the salt flavor was too strong. We all agreed that the popcorn tasted fresh and the serving size was not too small. As a snack, I'd give it a 4 or 5 star rating depending on the household member rating it. As a 'healthier' option (which Snack Well's promotes) I think it is no better than other candied popcorns on the market. With 5 % total fat (vs 3%) and 13 % saturated (vs 0) I would not always choose it over our preferred candy popcorn brand, despite it tasting much fresher. That said, I would certainly get it for a change of pace, it's a very tasty treat.<br /><br />Ingredients: Brown Sugar, Popcorn, Sugar, Corn Syrup, Palm and/or Palm Kernel Oil, Skim Milk, Cocoa, Whey Powder, Salt, Soybean Oil, Soy Lecithin, Vanilla Extract.<br />Calories 130<br />Calories From Fat 25",3
"First let me say that this is only my opinion, and you know what ""they"" say about opinions...<br />A while ago I found that I had to give up coffee, which for me was tough because coffee and water are about the only two things I drink. I've never been a milk drinker, nor have I ever been big on juice. And forget tea - maybe some herb tea before bed but it's nothing I want during the day while I'm working. Enter the ""coffee substitute"". I found numerous brands on line. All of them claim to taste ""just like the real thing"" and have plenty of reviews by people just like you and me saying how wonderful the stuff is. You could probably serve these people a cup of hot yak urine and tell them it was coffee and they would tell you it was delicious. The truth is, NOTHING but coffee tastes like coffee, and anyone that tries to tell you otherwise needs a new set of taste buds. All of the coffee substitutes I've tried taste like exactly what they're made from - roasted grains, nuts and roots. Most of them contain roasted carob. Carob DOES NOT taste anything like coffee; for one, it's way too sweet. You don't want anything that contains carob. Substitutes made with dates and figs are equally as repulsive. Again - way too sweet. One of the things that gives coffee its appeal is its bitterness. A good coffee substitute has to have some bitterness. So far the only thing I've found that comes close is Orzo brand roasted organic Italian barley. If you drink it black it satisfies like coffee. It takes a few cups but it starts to ""grow on you""; after drinking it for a week I've found I like it just as much as, and maybe even prefer it to, coffee. For one thing, it doesn't upset an empty stomach the way coffee does, and you can drink it after dinner without fear of it keeping you up all night.",5
"This is difficult to find in the stores.  It is high in fiber, delicious, and easy to prepare. Very Mediterranean. It arrived promptly. Would definitely purchase again.",5
"I like putting granola clusters on top of my oatmeal or use them as cereal - I could not do it with this. This is purely for snacking, finger food, and it's perfect for that purpose.<br /><br />The chocolate isn't very chocolatey, but it's a bit bitter. The cinnamon is very strong. In fact, I think the cinnamon flavor is much stronger than the chocolate. Overall, I enjoyed this snack as a snack, but it really isn't more useful than a snack. I really wanted to use it in my cereal, or as a cereal.<br /><br />It isn't too sweet, which is a big plus. Even though I give it a four star, some of my friends loved it. They would have likely given it five stars.",4
"I thought I was buying the organic, but this was relatively good.  I used it all, won't be buying it again.",4
"The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed, Bath and Beyond or Kohls.",1

"This is the best thing ever for giving meds in pill form to a pet.  Each little ""pocket"" is the consistency of a soft brownie.  So they are easy to mold around even a large pill.  I have 2 dogs and both take meds with these, no picking them apart, they just swallow them whole!  Both of my dogs are small (20#) so I usually don't even use a whole pocket for their meds, I break one in half and it's plenty to cover the pill.  Great solution and really makes things so much easier when pets are sick and not even wanting to eat.  I will always keep these on hand now.",5
"When I got these in the mail last Saturday and opened them up, put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of, offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death!  We have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese, so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and I were both excited.  Then that afternoon for her last dose for the day, same performance.  We thought we had found the answer to our prayers as she has a disease that can't be cured if she doesn't take this medication until it's all gone.  So this was a Godsend!<br /><br />But, the very next morning, before she had anything else to eat, my wife tried to give her a pill using a Pocket and she turned her nose up at it and walked away!!  She tried several times with varying amounts of the pocket cut off to make it smaller for her and easier to gulp down.  Still no go.  So we waited a couple of hours, without feeding her anything at all, tried again, same thing.<br /><br />So I saw a bag of Pockets in Walmart and the only thing they had besides Beef was Duck so I tried that.  Same thing.  Wouldn't even eat one so we're back to looking for something else that might work.  If your dog will eat them they are GREAT!!",3
"I am Brooky,  a very big Newfoundland Lab mix - I am 145lbs and have a very delicate stomach - the Instinct grain-free lamb formula does the trick- not only do I love it (my Mom mixes it with the Instinct Grain free lamb or beef canned dog food) but it does not make my  poor little tummy upset.

I eat if for breakfast with the Instinct biscuits as well as for dinner with the canned food.<br />It makes me happy and keeps my coat shiny so I look and feel my best !",5
"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.",1

"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.",5

"The Harbinger is one of the hottest chiles know to man.<br /><br />So it comes as no surprise that this Harbinger based sauce is quite hot - a few drops will go a long way. Yet, despite its considerable heat, it offers no other flavors beyond a vague hint of tomatoes combined with a very nasty and bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Ingredients - as copied from the label: Water, Harbinger pepper, tomato, salt, spices ... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: there is a LOT of heat in this sauce but little else --- except a vague hint of tomato and a very noticeable and bitter aftertaste!<br /><br />If you want even more heat (for some bizarre reason) there are other Habanero sauces where the Habanero chile is the major ingredient rather than water. There are also pepper extracts where gloves and eye protection are recommended if pure heat is what you are after.

"I love these bags already.  I have been using them for about a week and am in love with the product.  I had been using the lansinoh and medela bags.  I love the medela because you can pump right into them but I find them very expensive. I needed an alternative.  I took a chance and chose these bags.  I like them because they hold 6 oz of milk, are biodegradable, tamper resistant and have an easy pour spout.  The only thing they need is to have an adapter so that you can pump directly into the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11<br />I happened to get to the last few bags in one of my boxes of 25 (out of 75) and noticed several pin sized holes in the bottom of at least 3 bags.  I discovered the holes because I added milk to the bag and noticed milk at the bottom, I wiped it away and noticed the drop kept coming back.  When i squeezed the bag to determine where the hole was I noticed 4 small holes in the bottom. i poured the milk into another bag and the same thing happened.  Tried it again and it happened.  I poured the milk in a bottle and put it in the fridge.  I've decided to stop using these temporarily as I can't afford to waste milk.  I was so excited about this product now I'm sad.  Maybe I should contact the manufacturer.  I also wonder because I have 72 frozen bags that I'll have to carefully defrost.",3

"This stuff is really, really good--maybe too good. It would be way too easy to pig-out and eat the whole pan full in one sitting. I tried several other brands I obtained locally. They weren't too bad--if you slathered enough butter on them to cover the taste. You don't need butter to make this brand eatable. I don't know how this product could improved upon even if one was cooking from scratch. It's easy too. Just add water and cook. You can even microwave it, although I haven't tried that.

I realize dogs can choke on any product but I began to get very nervous.<br /><br />Flossies are great! Each Flossie lasts a lot longer than an individual Greenie did and they appear to be digested better by my<br />dog.  The crude protein in Greenies states ""not less than 52 per cent"" and in Flossies it states Crude Protein, minimum 89.73 per cent!"" It is a low fat treat that my precious ""baby"" loves.<br /><br />By the way, in fairness to Greenies, they have come out with a wonderful ""SMART BISCUIT"" that is very digestible for dogs, as well as a treat called BARX, which is a very healthy soft snack stick.<br /><br />But Flossies will last your dog a long time and Bonnie guards her's ferociously!",5
I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it!,5
"I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.<br /><br />It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.",1
"It is fun for my toy poodle, but the yellow ""caps"" are too large for him to get his mouth around to remove them. He does enjoy moving the ""cover"" around so he can retrieve the treats.",3
"This is the hottest stuff I have every tried, and I have tried alot. When you first put it in your mouth its not bad but after bout 10-15 seconds you can't do anything but hang on for the ride. Ane believe me the ride is not fun. This stuff shoud be kept way out of reach of any children or people with heart problems.<br /><br />  ****IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL****",1
"Okay, so I got stuck in a small town in the middle of the Midwest for two months and this was the only premade satay sauce available... I paid the price for my laziness when I made Thai satay chicken with this. I'm pretty sure the makers of this have never actually tasted Thai peanut sauce. If you want to make this yourself, just mix a huge amount of vinegar with salt and a dash of peanut butter.<br /><br />Seriously.",1
"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now.",1
"I had this coffee at our local country club.  (I was a guest!)  Then my employer started using it.<br />I can't get my home recipe down.  It just doesn't taste the same.  Then I found out that what my employer uses is already made and is in a cardboard box (like some wines), so the taste is always the same --- delicious.  I will continue to work on my recipe.",3
"First we like canned salmon, a lot!  So you have to go from that angle.  This is a great product, it is kosher and has good flavor.  If you don't like canned salmon you won't like this but if you do you will be happy.  I didn't find a lot of fat, skin, or bones but just what you would expect.",4
"This was my first purchase of this brand of dog cookies. I cook everything my dogs eat so I am always looking for things to keep in the pantry that are human grade ingredients and made in the USA to help me out when I am short on time. My Papillon is severely  allergic to flaxseed, soy, oats, brewers yeast and chicken which rules out most commercial foods and cookies. I was very disappointed in how stale these were and skimpy with the bacon bits. Call me crazy but I did a taste test like I do on my homemade dog cookies made with human grade ingredients. The expiration date was still a year away but without preservatives these have a much shorter shelf life than that. I store homemade dog cookies in the fridge or freezer to preserve quality but was hoping the claim of ""made fresh daily"" on the cute bag was true. My dogs and I give these ""Four Paws Down"".",1
"Firstly, it's hypersweet.  It's sweeter than mountain dew, and that's just wrong.  They need to lighten up on the Stevia with this particular product in their lineup.<br /><br />Next, and just to explain to the ladies, there's a small hockey puck shaped thing, usually pink that sits in a men's bathroom urinals called a 'urinal cake', placed in the line of fire to mask foul odors.  Most of the time, it's a fake cherry smell or a janitorial, industrial 'red' scent, but sometimes it's fakeLymon - fake lemon / fake lime.<br /><br />Zevia Mountain Zevia tastes like how fakelymon smells.<br /><br />They are probably cut from the same fakesensoryindustialscentingagents cloth at discount monsanto, any random industrial chemical scenting and flavoring agents manufacturer for the fakescented candles, car deodorizers, incenses, fakescented urinal cakes, fakescented alternative beverages/candies/other food products industries.<br /><br />Sorry guys, but Mountain Zevia is nasty.",2
"Vail Mountain Coffee might have their biggest fan in Dallas, TX. I have been addicted to the Gore Range Blend for months now and just am getting around to trying out their other blends. I can't speak highly enough about this coffee- way better than Starbucks or other higher end coffees that I have tried. Next I am on to the Bridge Street Blend. I will update with a review of Bridge Street after I try it.",5
"This is a nice item -- chunks of meat, good gravy. My cat is not fond of all the varieties, but it is a nice little treat nonetheless.<br /><br />But I do think this item is a bit pricy ... about $1 per 3-ounce can.",4
"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence.",4
"I was looking for something to flavor my coffee with as creamers dont taste like much when you try to control the serving to one tablespoon. This is a great way to give coffee lots of flavor while keeping the calorie count in check. One its own it can be a bit bland and is definitely not as flavorful as real full calorie hot chocolate. As a diet drink though, it packs plenty of flavor with it's 25 calorie label. Definitely will keep buying.",4
"The box was too big for the product. For future times, I believe 2 package of Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix would fix into 1 box.",5
"This popcorn is an excellent middle ground between popcorn with alot of butter & the<br />popcorn that is 94% [or more] reduced fat/butter & as a result is really way too dry! The taste has just enough flavor but not overly oily, etc. Sometimes we actually mix a light butter or movie theater butter flavor with this 50% less fat version & it results in all around very tasty popcorn. The health aspects of this popcorn has been commented on before in other reviews, however I will say, it seems that the overall fat content is in fact relatively low. As has been mentioned by other reviewers this popcorn is VERY hard to find generally in stores & I am wondering if Conagra is in the process of discontinuing this product?? In any case as long as Amazon carries it we will buy it!!",5
"I ordered this fruit basket for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  The product arrived on time, and my mother-in-law loved it.",5
"This product was a great deal when I first signed up for subscribe and save. Started off at $10.93, then when up to $11.03, then wow, $19.00. I understand a little price increase, but this is ridiculous",2
"I'm not sure what happened to my other review, but it didn't go through.  This 8 O'clock coffee is sour and bitter, no matter much much or little coffee I add, and no matter how much water I put.  It was like this the first day I got it.  I try coffee I buy from Lucky's or Costco and it's nothing like this.  This is the worst coffee I ever taste.  It's so bad that if I had to do it all over again, I would ask for a refund.  I keep the beans in an airtight mason jar.  Like I said, day one and it was sour and bitter so I gotta write this review.  Google around and you'll see people say the same.  I am not sure if I have a bad batch or what.<br /><br />I've also read that pretty much all coffee roasted coffee bean you buy has gone stale in about 2 or so weeks after roasting.  I've recently ordered green coffee beans and will be roasting it myself.  I've tried a few bags of pre-roasted beans, they're nothing special, but this one is just awful.  I've now decided to cold press this 8 O'clock coffee to see if i can improve the taste and finish it.",1
"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.",4
"I recently took a pack of these chews and it worked pretty well. I went out on a 16 mile run and pulled out the chews early on in the run. I love the taste of the raspberry but the chewing is impossible! I tried to chew it enough to get the gel to come out but it was impossible. So I just ended up swallowing it whole after failed attempts at chewing. Other than the chewing, the taste is great! Training for the Marine Corps Marathon 2012!",4
"A bit ambivalent about this drink, as it has its pros and cons.  The fruit punch has a nice flavor to it, not too sweet but about what you'd expect for a flavor enhancer.  It says that one squeeze will do for 8 ounces, but mileage can vary per that squeeze (depending on how much force you use).  Maybe I'm not squeezing that much.  You have to be careful removing the inner seal, something that can be a bit nerve-wracking considering the red coloring of the contents.  I'm also not sure how much of a boost the caffeine will give.  If you want to carry this around to flavor your water all day, you might want to rethink that considering the size (similar to that of a ketchup bottle).<br /><br />That said, it does have a nice list of vitamins and no carbs or calories (which is a lot better than most 'vitamin' waters out there that you buy by the bottle at quite the cost - as long as you don't mind fake sugar) and should last you a while.  It's great to keep at the office or home.",3
"I love this drink. Squeeze a bit into water, lemonade , or club soda. This tastes great. I found it to have a fruit taste a little sweet, and the best part you do not have to use a lot. I found it out to be  better then the Mio. Fits in my bag, no more pricey drinks at stores no more. A few drops and I have a refreshing drink. Everyone in my family really enjoyed it as well.",5
"I've been drinking this stuff for years, but since we move every two years with the military, it can be difficult to find in local stores. We've just moved back to CT and I can't find it anywhere. It may be a little pricey purchasing it here, but it's absolutely worth it.<br /><br />I've tried various types of ciders in k-cup form, and they were awful. I always find myself going back to Alpine's cider packets. My whole family loves them. My husband, who usually sticks with coffee, drinks a cup every night before bed, and my 4 year old would drink this all day if I let him. If you like cider and have never tried this stuff, then I absolutely recommend it. I'm so glad I can purchase such a large quantity here at Amazon.",5
I'm rarely blown away by a seasoning product.  This salt is exactly what everyone else says.  AMAZING!  Perfect for my home theater.,5
My friends that received it threw out the candy becasue the said the chocolate was statel.  I was very disappointed in this product and would not buy from them again,1
"I have sprayed this on my garbage several times, which was getting tipped over weekly by squirrels in the neighberhood stopping in for 'dinner'.  I doused the outside of the can with this and the squirrels haven't dined on us for a while.  What's nice in no squirrels are hurt and I'm sure they will go elsewhere for another good meal.",5
"I lived in the ROK for a few years, this was one of my favorite ramyun's (as they call it over there).  One thing to note, very few Korean's eat ramyun noodle as it is very high in fat, they prefer to use rice instead.<br /><br />Maybe some day, we'll be able to buy a bi-bim-bap DIY kit on here too.",5
"Not surprisingly, Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with Fiber, tastes just like regular Splenda. The packets have a little more weight to them and a tendency to cake more than the standard Splenda but they dissolve completely and blend right in to hot or cold foods and in baking. If you are looking for a way to add more fiber to your diet in an unobtrusive manner, this is a pretty good way. After all, getting fiber from your morning coffee, with no determinable change in taste or texture, is a good thing in my book.",5
"You get what you pay for!<br />These are the best tasting coconut chips ever created.The flavor is intense without being tooo sweet.Once you try these you will become addicted and will be a repeat customer forever.Don't forget to try the other choices in the line-up, you will be equally pleased.",5
"I'm not a tea connoisseur, but I found this tea very weak. I love the Tazo black tea and the Twinings Green for Tassimo much better.",2
This is a nice assortment of teas. I do wish that I could more easily find individual flavors because this is a great way to figure out what you like and then order more of that.,5
"Awful Awful taste...and phosphoric sick color...<br />Awful Awful taste...and phosphoric sick color...<br />Awful Awful taste...and phosphoric sick color...<br /><br />I was totally schemed, this is not a drink. it is an acid poison.<br />Who for god sake manufacture and sale this kind of awful product.<br /><br />Don't believe it? try for your self.<br />I only show ""The king is naked""",1
My dog broke both back molars chewing on VeggieDents. My dog is a Corgi around 32 pounds. The Vet thought she had been chewing rocks in the backyard. I would pass on these chews for the safety of your dogs teeth.,1
I really love the flavor of this coffee.  It smells and tastes great.  Comparable to any high end flavored coffee.,5
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LAQ"">Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea, Tea Bags, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />This is the best Green Tea we have found. It is smooth and has a great flavor, something missing in most.<br /><br />My only problem was that the Amazon description makes you think you are getting one 40 package box per order so I ordered two. Now we have enough tea for quite a while.",5
"these are the best i go to weigh watchers and they are hard to find in the stores and they taste so good, i have a bag a day, and they are only 3 points for the whole bag",5
"Great tasting BBQ Chips. Going to buy more.<br /><br />At first, looking at the size of the bags, and just thinking about the concept of ""Popped chips"" I was on the fence. Glad I finally made up my mind.<br /><br />My only complaint is, that these bags are so small. I want to purchase a regular size bag. Maybe a box of six or something. Because if you buy in bulk you save. Having to buy a box of 24... all that extra packaging is going to cost you.",5
We ordered a case of these without never having tried them before and were pleasantly surprised...They have a distinct flavor and are VERY ADDICTING!!!  The only down thing I can say is that when you open the package there is only around 1/2 of a bag and they are gone before you know it~,4
"I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!",1
"While I wouldn't call them nutritious, these noodles are very tasty and take almost no time to prepare, making them a perfect last minute lunch when combined with some veggies. This product happens to be vegan and gluten free, which is great for those who avoid animal products and/or gluten! The sauce is delicious and more than enough for the amount of noodles so you can either stir in some extras (I like peas with this) or some additional rice noodles; I add about 1/4 to 1/3 more rice noodles from a separate package to compensate for the extra sauce. Everyone in my family enjoys these!<br /><br />NOTE: I noticed that the ingredients listed on Amazon differ from those on the packages I have. Amazon's ingredient list includes soy and the list on mine does not. I am not sure why that is but I guess the ingredients in this may have changed or will change?",5
"I have pretty bad dandruff. I have tried pretty much every shampoo out there (even using prescription shampoo from my dr. at one point)  Now I use Head and Shoulders regularly and it seems to work OK.  I was excited to try this product b/c you can apply it to wet or dry hair.  The first time I used it on my wet hair immediately after getting out of the shower. It felt nice and light on my scalp and dried out nicely in my hair, leaving no real noticeable residue or greasy look to my scalp.  Then I decided to try it on my dry hair.  It went in nicely again, and I used the same amount I did when applying it to wet hair.  It didn't absorb as well and did leave my hair a bit greasy looking-not like ""eww, she needs a shower"" greasy, but more like ""oh, you haven't washed your hair in 2 days greasy"".  Overall, it feels good on the scalp and does seem to alleviate the visible flakes.  I would say don't use it on dry hair, though, make it part of your just out of the shower routine for best results.",4
"We've previously been very happy with the ready to feed bottles of similac. Our son likes them, spits up less and the bottles are very convenient when we're out and about. They are however fairly heavy and not so cost efficient, so we decided to buy the singles.<br /><br />Unfortunately the idea of the singles are better than the actual use. Size and price is good, but the powder does not dissolve easily. You either have to shake very hard, or shake gently for a very long time to dissolve the powder. So if you have a hungry infant, your choice is to have the baby scream because of hunger whilst preparing the formula, or risk an upset stomach later as the heavy shaking traps airbubbles in the formula. Naturally you could prepare the formula prior to the time of feeding, but in a way that defeats the purpose of the singles. The formula must also be used within a certain period of time, so your infant needs to be pretty regular in terms of feedingtimes.<br /><br />All in all, I think it deserves a some positive feedback on the quality of the formula and the convenient packaging, but unfortunately the cons outweighs the pros on this particular product.",2
"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.",2
Great tasting Chai.  Chai K-Cups are hard to find at the brick and mortars around my house.  This is a great deal and a great tasting tea.,5
"This is definitely a nice everyday green tea, with almost no astringency and a buttery, nutty flavor. Both the dry leaf color and the infusion color are greener than most Chinese green teas, but otherwise it's pretty standard (in a good way).  I liked this one better than Rishi's Emerald Lily green tea, which is more expensive and pretty similar tasting overall.",4
"Not a bad Kona blend, my main gripe is when it arrived it had a large hole in the bag, because it was just rolling around in the box. Poor shipping. As to the coffee, well, it didn't suit my tastes but who's to say if it was good seeing as there was a hole in the bag when I got it?",3
"If you're going to complain about the firmness of these Haribo Candies then obviously you've never had other Haribo products. They are meant to be firm so it doesn't take half a second to gulp one down. Take your time eating them instead of shoving 10 in your mouth at once. Maybe then you'll realize gummy bears are better firm. They last longer and you don't have to eat as many to get the same satisfaction. Typical American mentality, you want them soft so you don't even have to chew them right?",5
"I am an offshore fisherman working on small boats. My partner is german and his family carries this product<br />with them on board to ease their stomachs. While its no cure for serious sea sickness I find these liquorice drops very settling for a queazy stomach.<br /><br />Also this ""candy"" is not overly sweet  -  a problem I have with most similar American made products. Only Problem is that once I start eating them I want to devour the whole package!",5
I expected a little more coconut flavor and a little less dark chocolate....but overall a nice flavored coffee.,4
"I liked these treats very much for using in training.  First, I appreciate the bulk size they sell them in and I feel good that it's made in the USA.  Second, I like that I can easily cut them into smaller bites or break them up to make them last.  All 4 of my dogs love them and I'm able to use them as a high level treat for harder commands.  Also - my puppy who is 15 weeks old had no problems digesting them.<br />All in all a 5 star product in my opinion.",5
"I KNOW YOU MAY BE CONFUSED BECAUSE I GAVE IT 5 STARS BUT WROTE BUYER BEWARE.<br />LET ME EXPLAIN<br />5 STARS IS BECAUSE THE TREATS ARE GREAT THICK MOIST AND CHEWEY AND MY DOG LOVES THEM AND I GIVE ""ADDICTION DOG FOOD"" 5 STARS FOR THEIR PRODUCT<br />HOWEVER<br />I GIVE THE STORE THAT YOU ORDER THIS FROM 1 STAR IF I COULD GIVE IT LESS I WOULD!! IT IS A RIP OFF AND JIP<br />IT SAYS YOU GET 12 OZ BAG....UMMM NOT! YOU 100% GET ""ONLY A 4OZ BAG""<br />THIS COMPANY ALSO SENDS OLD STUFF. NOT ONCE NOT TWICE BUT 3XS THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I STAY CLEAR OF THEM NOW!",5
"Once we tasted PG Tips, no other tea cuts it.  And buying it at Amazon was almost a steal compared to local stores.",5
The Battalion Command Sergeant Major turned me onto this coffee while I was in Iraq. It was a staple of the military field units. Great for a quick pick-me-up when you start to get that middle afternoon nod going. Problem is in the military it was free.Here at home you have to pay for it. Individual cans are hard to find in my area so I purchase via Amazon. The Shock Latte (and Mocha) are pricey but I believe well worth it. It needs to be well chilled and shaken before it is drinkable. Great flavor and very effective. I like it better than Starbucks or Red Bull and feel it is more effective. I'd have rated it 5 stars except for the per unit price.,4
I like the good price and taste and just the fact it is organic so when my picky child eats badly at least I know it is not all that bad ... .,5
"Not that big of a mustard fan, but what I will say is  gulden's mustard definitely brings out the flavor",5
These things are really tasty!  We find it takes effort to stop eating them.  They are great with dips or alone.  Highly recommended.,5
"This is a very nice popping oil made from soybean oil. Makes one of the best tasting popcorns I have made. A medium body oil. They say you can use it as a topping oil as well, but I like the popcorn just the way it comes out using the oil as a popper. Please, Hometown Favorites $36.50 for 4 bottles?? I can buy it at WalMart for $3.25 a bottle and sell it myself for 100% profit and it wouldn't cost nearly as much. Gotta love these greedy people. I can't believe these companies stay in  business charging these outrageous prices. Oh well, I guess you're not forced to buy from them, thank goodness.",5
"I BOUGHT ABOUT 20 PACKAGES AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED, OR TIRED OF USING THE FLAVOR.GREAT PRICE,EASY TO FIX, AND VOILA A GREAT DISH COOKED WITH MINIMUM EASE.GOES WITH FISH,MEATS,CHICKEN AND JUST ABOUT MOST THINGS YOU CAN ENJOY.",5
"it is really good coffee, my italian friend recommended this product!!<br /><br />and i tried... and.... i like it so much... i ordered 8 bags...",5
"Foolish me, I ordered these for my husband who is on some newfangled diet, so I wasn't as careful as I usually am, and I love Eden products, and I thought these would be fine, but they have shoyu in them which means soy and wheat and wheat means gluten, so we can't eat them.  I am sure they must be delicious if you can eat soy and gluten!",1
My 7 month old son liked the taste but immediately bit off a huge chunk and began to choke. I had to get it out myself because it doesn't dissolve fast enough. My 9 month old nephew did the same thing. I don't consider these safe for babies.,1
"I have two Burmese cats, and both of them are being or were raised on this kitten formula (one is 13 months, the other is 8 months).  They have been on it since they were 4 months old.  I did a lot of research into food recommended by my breeder since we spent a lot of money on the cats.  I ultimately decided on this brand because of the research they have done.  I plan on putting both of them on the Persian formula (that is for Himalayans and Burmese too) because these types of cats are prone to getting a certain type of UTI and need their urine a different pH.<br />Their fur has never been softer, they are so active and always chasing each other, they are very playful with us.  We always comment on how soft the older one is, just like a pillow, and the younger one is getting closer every day.  They eat the food I leave out for them every day, so I'm assuming it is satisfying.  I just love this brand and plan on sticking with them, even when we get dogs.",5
"This coffee is bold and rel,y gets you going! My husband loves how it really gets him going! Full bodied and delicious! Coffee came fast. Great seller item packed well.",5
"This is a fine shampoo for clearing up flaking or dry skin however it does leave my scalp and the roots of my hair slightly oily.  This would be a huge problem if I had very long hair or possibly a problem for men with longer hair.  It definitely works nicely, but would be best suited for women with a short/cropped haircut or men with very short hair.",4
"I really liked the way this holder looked in the picture, but when I received it, it didn't sit evenly on the countertop and was very flimsy. I returned it and ordered a k-cup carousel, which I love!",1
"Strangely enough, my kitteh doesn't like most catnip toys.. but she absolutely loves these.. especially the carrot!! I orginally found them at petco. purchasing from amazon is much cheaper than the manufacturer!",5
"While traveling in Ireland 12 years ago I discovered this excellent tea.  My European husband and I both love it......his with milk, mine with a little sugar.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon and order it regularly as needed.",5
"Tried the steak frites and the 9 liver...both cats will eat the steak without hesitation, the nine liver chicken is a different story...thanks amazon for standing by your products...",5
"My cat loves all the Weruva varieties. I rotate between Wellness wet and dry, Merrick wet, and frozen Country Pet products but she always chows this stuff down in one sitting without leaving a trace. And this stuff does look good when you open it. If I'm ever reduced to one of those declining fixed income seniors eating cat food you used to read about, well, it could be worse...",5
"This was always one of my favorite Chunky soups.  However it seems that when Campbell started advertising their new 'leaner cuts' they interpreted those words to mean quantity rather than quality. Last can of Sirloin Burger contained 4 pieces of meat (2 per serving).  Same with their Select soup.  My White Bean Chicken Chili also contained 4 pieces of chicken for the 2 servings. Guess it was a way to cut down on production costs but not price. I like to get what, I hope at least, I'm paying for.  I complained to Campbell but never heard back on my e-mail. Since then I have switched to Progresso and other brands.",2
My dogs LOVE this stuff!! It smells good and it is healthy and made out of organic real meat.<br />My chihuahua will eat half patty in the morning and the other half for dinner. A 16oz bag will last about a month. Well worth it.,5
This product Ozery Bakery makes is the best that i every had in a long time.all of the morning rounds that i had is all good .You must try this product for youself,5
"After finding these candies at Costco, the office got hooked on them.  Then Costco quit carrying them (of course).  Amazon is the only place I can find them.  I order them by the case!",5
"I used to give my 7 month Lab mix puppy Blue Buffalo Bits but I stopped because of the price and this resulted to be a great substitute! These are a whole lot cheaper - I paid about $7 for a 1lb bag of treats and my puppy enjoys them. They are a little ""greasy"" but that's expected since they are 'moist'. I usually train my puppy with a mix of kibble, biscuits and cut up greenies and this is a great addition to the mix.",5
"Just adding my 5 stars to the many 5 star reviews here. Both my border collie and very fussy Siberian Huskie love these treats. I use them for training, and they've worked better than anything (except cheese and hot dogs).",5
"These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks; I've been waiting a month for the item.",4
"We have used this extra virgin olive oil for years. It is the best tasting oil for salads, cooking and dipping.  We used to drive to Tarpon Springs, Fl. (Greek Town) to buy it and now we just order it through Amazon.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.",5
"I have tried many different k-cups and Tully's is my favorite. I like the taste because it is a little sweet and doesn't have much acid. It's perfect for that first cup of coffee, as well as at any time during the day or night. Really good coffee.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised when we bought this cereal. I think it tastes better than the Peanut Butter Captain Crunch I used to enjoy. It is super crunchy and the peanut butter flavor is yummy. My 3 year old loves it and after all that is who I am trying to please! It is cheaper at my local grocery store for the 10.6 oz boxes, but Amazon has the 25 oz bags (3 packs) available, which gets me the most cereal for the least cost. Enjoy!!",5
"These taste good, but I still prefer just regular salted pork rinds. Plus they have MSG added, probably from the red pepper spices used, because the regular salted ones does not.",3
"These were definitely not from England.  Arabic written all over it.  These are most likely the ones imported from the factory in India.  While they tasted good, they were not very fresh.  Would not buy from this seller again.",2
I use this product as a skin oil. I don't like the taste of coconuts so the smell was a bit to overcome initially (more potent than previous brand I used); but I got used to it,4
"Tully's Italian Roast is a full bodied cup of coffee without bitterness.  Great with dessert or after dinner.  Good flavor at mid-size cup or next size up.  Too weak at the largest cup size.  Now, if we just get the price down a bit. . .",4
"My cat was recently put on a renal diet (Hills HD), and because he's allergic to corn, he threw up every time he ate.  The second ingredient is corn gluten meal, the third pork fat.  Yuck.  The Blue Buffalo Grain Free Dry Cat Food changed my life and his in one meal.  He has had breakfast, lunch and dinner today and not thrown up once.  And he loves it.  And he doesn't complain about being hungry every hour.  He is happy, content, and satisfied with small portions.  And so are my other two cats.  What a relief.  I also ordered the duck both canned and dry after calling Blue Buffalo to find out the levels of phosphorus and sodium.  They said that the Basic duck and potato, dry, and the Wilderness duck canned are the lowest. I called my vet and he was shocked (in a good way) that they were so low. He said some of the renal diets are higher than Blue Buffalo.  I love this brand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.",5
"If you are a fan of Slim Jim, buying this package is perfect. Each Slim Jim is packed in a small, snack sized plastic wrap and the price is really great for the 100 Slim Jims this package offers. With that said, this is not the most healthy product...think, sodium, preservatives, fat, and the list goes on...If you are okay with the health factor though, this package is great.",3
"I saw these in Scotland this past summer up above Lock Tay near Ben Lawlers in a small mountain town.  We used to buy Danish meat pies like these here in the states but sadly they are no longer available.  Anyway I ordered one to see how it was.<br /><br />It was very tasty and we enjoyed it very much.  However, the price and the time to get it from England to here in the USA is not good.  Price is way too high and time to receive it is very long.  Still . . . as a rare treat I may buy another in the future.",3
"My 5 yo loves these cookies.  There are very few gluten free, egg free cookies out there that taste good, and these are one of them.  My father visited and ate some before I could tell him they were my son's ""special"" cookies, and he couldn't even tell they were gluten free.  I sent a package to my son's school so that for special events they have them on hand, and my son isn't excluded....in fact just yesterday they had a Teddy Bear Tea, and even he was able to have a plate of cookies like everyone else in the class.<br />I am so glad we found these...",5
"I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that ""practice makes perfect"".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.",4
"This apple sauce is really tasty, slightly tart and not too sweet.  Its' texture is smoother than most apple sauce.  We have it regularly delivered through the Subscribe & Save program.",5
"All  of Bonnie""s country classics are fabulous. The Peach corn salsa however, is absolutely the best we have ever tasted. It makes you want to eat it out of the jar with a spoon.",5
"My son works full time & is a college student, he loves these! They are all good & easy for him to fix. I have ordered many!",5
This is the first variety of Hormel compleats I have tried & I must say that I am not satisfied with it. It has a peculiar taste to the gravy but but for a quick meal I guess it is ok. Also the price per pkg was high for the quality of the product. I would probably not recomend this product to anyone.<br /><br />D.Martinez<br />Dbn Hts<br />Michigan,3
"This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my ""diet food.""  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!",5
"The first thing I noticed when opening the bag was the chemical stench of plastic fumes.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the lack of vitamins and minerals contained in the product.<br /><br />Despite these two flaws, I was at least somewhat satisfied with the product -- its only saving grace being that it tasted OK.",3
"We have a 75 lb doberman who is constantly on the move. We bought this toy and he loves it. He was able to pop the treat out within the first 15 minutes but we took it and crammed the whole thing in the middle of the toy. He now works at getting it out for an hour or more at a time. If he leaves the room where the toy is and comes back to find it, he immediately picks it up and starts playing with it again.<br /><br />He has only had it for 2 days but it seems to be holding up well.",5
I'm glad I got to try this before I actually purchased it.  I would not purchase these.  The initial flavor was ok then it left a kind of chemically after taste.  It kind of reminded me of eating a cookie with the texture of a biscuit.  I definitely needed something to wash it down.,2
"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.",3
"I've gotten the 3 pack a couple times now, going on my 3rd.  It's pretty good coffee.  Each bag so far has been very fresh and they smell like pure bliss as almost chocolatey aromas hit your nose when you open the bags.  Each bag is very consistent too which is hard to find with coffee sometimes.",5
um they just packaged tuna n these small packets about the size of tuna from grocery store and not much better tasting .. dont waste ur $... not smoked salmon im used 2.. lol,1
"Hesitantly, I ordered these in a case (12 cans) on our 1st try. What a pleasant surprise! They are very tasty and the texture is great. My husband, a carnivore, can't tell the difference in his signature buffalo chili. They're now on auto-ship to our home every few months. A great swap-out for eating lower-carb.<br /><br />The texture is - as far as I can tell - identical to traditional black beans. The flavor is a little different (not worse) than traditional canned black beans, but when seasoning is added, I couldn't tell one bit of difference.<br /><br />Note: I didn't even think about this before ordering, but after receipt inspected the nutrition label and found that these black beans actually have more calories per serving than traditional black beans (Trader Joe's). It's not much of a difference (I'm still on the black soy bean bandwagon), but it's something to consider.<br /><br />Here are the side-by-side nutrition facts, soy compared to traditional canned black beans from Trader Joe's (serving size: 130g):<br />Calories:  120 (soy) - 100 (TJ's)<br />Total Fat:  6g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Saturated Fat:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Trans Fat:  0g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Cholesterol:  0mg (soy) - 0mg (TJ's)<br />Sodium:  30mg (soy) - 440mg (TJ's)<br />Potassium:  310mg (soy) - not provided (TJ's)<br />Total Carbohydrates:  8g (soy) - 19g (TJ's)<br />-Dietary Fiber:  7g (soy) - 4g (TJ's)<br />-Sugars:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Protein:  11g (soy) - 7g (TJ's)",5
"Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title",1
"I have very small dogs (5 and 7 lbs) and it doesn't take them long to gobble this down, so I hope it works at cleaning their teeth.  The dogs can't wait for this; they love it better than other treats!",5
"I love Lundberg's rice products and black japonica is no exception. This is nutty and full-bodied, closer to wild rice that white or even brown. Try sauteing an onion first, then add water and rice and cook. Stands on its own and is so delicious!",5
My 18 year old son loves these Panda Puffs!  He eats them every day before heading out to his early morning job.  It doesn't seem to bother him that there's a picture of a couple of cute and cuddly panda bears.  He's just happy to have a GOOD alternative!,5
"This is very good oatmeal... if you have the luxury of an extra half-hour of time in the morning.  Better option is the McCann's Quick and Easy item... same oats, just cut finer to quick faster.  I use a small rice cooker to cook oatmeal... great way to cook oatmeal.",4
I tried this product at an OH conference when the girls had it on tap. I am glad they did! It flowed day and evening and it started my addiction.<br />It is a great pick me up and I love the taste. I have pretty much stopped drinking all other protein shakes for this.<br />The only problem is remembering to order before I run out!!<br />I tell everyone to DRINK CLICK! I have even passed some samples on to the body building guys around here.,5
"Our Lhasa loves these Pork Chomps and they last her for more than an hour which is longer than most chew sticks.  As with all chew sticks, I keep a close watch while she is chewing the Pork Chomps to make sure she doesn't choke on a remaining piece of twistz if it is too small.  I am very happy with this selection.  It was packaged very well and shipped separately from other dog toys, and arrived within estimated two business days shipment.  I ordered two packages which should last a couple of months or more.",5
"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped.",2
Great popcorn!! Good popping results and wonderful flavor.  Can't help but love it and I will re-order when I run out.  Recommend to one and all,5
"I  was pleased to,read about these treats and thought what a good time my dog would have with them. It lasted about 10 minutes. I think there is something amiss with the  product description",1
"This looks like the same macaroni and cheese you've been eatig for years, but now there are veggies hidden in the noodles.  I didn't taste a difference and I served it to my family without telling them.  I have four kids between the ages of 2 and 8 and the three who usualy eat mac and cheese ate this up without comment.  Even my husband, who can sometimes be as picky as a kid, didn't notice a difference.  We've been eating the whole grain version and the noodles in those boxes come out a bit firmer.  But even the texture change was pretty subtle.  As I said, none of my family could tell.<br /><br />On the other hand, I couldn't really give it five stars because the neon cheese is still neon cheese.  I stir in about a half a cup of shredded cheese whenever I make it and that really improves the cheese flavor, in my opinion.",4
"If you like super strong coffee, then take home this French Roast. I was a bit shocked at how strong it was actually. I like strong coffee but even this one set me back on my butt. Four stars for being too expensive.",4
"I opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl. One of the chips on top had something black on it. It looked like black tar or melted black crayon. I assumed it was a contaminant of some sort, since it didn't resemble any kind of food ingredient. I wish I had not bought these chips. I am now wary of all Kettle products.",1
"All I can say about honey pearls is that i just love it.  Lovely golden color in your tea..  Tremendous flavor.  Dissolves instantly.,  I need to order more.......",5
I can't find Bijol here in south Texas.  This came in just as promised.  I use it for my yellow rice and chicken (Cuban Style).,5
"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.",3
"Not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. We've cancelled our subscriptions to both the Chick Chick and Salmon HappyBaby pouches. A huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. Please bring back the old formula, HappyBaby!",1
Great way to get your daily fiber. I eat this every morning for breakfast along with my high fiber bread toast. Taste delicious too. The only problem I have is that it is way too sweet. Too much sugar. Otherwise excellent source of daily fiber.,5
"In the past, I would have to buy a large quantity of baker's ammonia which would dissipate with time.  I love the small quantity and it worked just fine in my special cookies.",5
